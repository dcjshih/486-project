        "Every garment empowers its maker \u2661 Naturally dyed, hand-crafted garments \u2014 valuing people and planet ReCreate exists to transform the lives of our makers through fair and purposeful employment, individual training and care. This tee will last season after season - the quality is amazing. The material is so thick and is just such a versatile piece in my wardrobe with its boxy fit. Joy Sweatshirt Tee | Natural Love love love this dress!! Beautiful thick that washes well. Cut and style is fab. Especially love the button detail at the back that pulls the waist in. Easy to wear. Looking forward to wearing across all seasons. River Denim Dress | Black I was so excited when I found the Joy Tee. I have never been able to wear a simple tee before and always struggled over the summer months. The joy tee has definitely brought me JOY! Perfect length in the arms to cover the bits I don\u2019t like, and it doesn\u2019t cling to my waist, but floats beautifully. I now have 2 of them! Joy Tee | Black The dress is well made and the fabric is stunning. It fits well and I feel proud to have supported a New Zealand based company. Array Dress | Daisy Check I'm very happy with how well this top sits and fits, the quality of the fabric and the obvious skill in the design and manufacture. Voyage Top | Khaki Love! I have every colour now. Thank you. Cabin Pant | Soft Navy Best beanie I\u2019ve ever owned. I have not been able to find a pure cotton beanie, it\u2019s always nasty acrylic and polyester which I react to. This doesn\u2019t itch me at all or cause rashes. Also, it\u2019s very well made! Rib Beanie | Blush Super in love with this dress! The unique details of pleats and cut of the dress make it such a fun dress to wear. I'm also impressed by the quality of how it was made. Has pockets which is always a bonus point for a dress. Degree Dress | Black Love this tee. Soft buttery cotton and very flattering cut. Will be buying in other colours! Ripple Tee | Black I love my new top! It\u2019s such a classic design and goes with so many outfits. Feels good to know that I\u2019m supporting an awesome brand when I wear it. Friday Top | Black It was love at first sight! Great dress up/dress down shirt with beautiful back detailing. Oversize fit (as per description) was what I wanted however if you wanted a more 'fitted' look, I'd recommend to size down. Found Shirt | Chalk The quality is just beautiful, as is the fit. This is a very versatile jacket that easily goes with dresses as much as jeans. Dress up or dress down - I can see myself getting a lot of wear out of this piece.

It's why we do, what we do. The majority of our partner factories are solar assisted, reducing CO2 during production. Our cotton is organic. Better for farmers, the planet and your skin. We buy in big quantities and miss out the retailer. Passing the savings straight to you. April 12, 2025 March 18, 2025 March 05, 2025 The story of Yes Friends BORN IN BRISTOLMADE IN INDIA We exist to make ethical clothing affordable and transform the fashion industry. Small goals.The fashion industry is broken.It is known for modern slavery, toxic dyes in rivers, a huge amount of waste and poor wages for garment workers.Nobody wants that.But \u00a380 for a sustainable T-shirt?! Nobody wants that either.And not buying clothes isn\u2019t an option either (nobody wants to see that).So in 2021 we launched Yes Friends with a sustainable & ethical T-shirt for the price of a pint in London.In our first month, we sold over 4,000 T-shirts.Journalists got the memo and we were featured in The Guardian, The Independent and Sky News.Since then, we\u2019ve released new sustainable collections, given thousands of pounds to garment workers and become the first UK brand to allow customers to tip garment workers directly. It\u2019s been a wild ride.And it all started by de-bunking a myth.The myth goes something like this \u201cIt\u2019s way too expensive to pay workers well and treat the planet well and run a successful business\u201d.But the truth is, it costs as little as 15p extra per T-shirt to pay workers a living wage in India, and less than 50p per tee for Fairtrade & organic cotton. Ethical doesn\u2019t need to be expensive, it just needs a bit of scale.Big scale, small margins.The secret sauce behind Yes Friends. We buy in big quantities and sell directly to you, missing out the middle person and passing the savings straight to you. So you get premium quality, ethical & sustainable clothing at a fraction of the cost.We don\u2019t stop there.We know waste doesn\u2019t work for the planet, you or me. So instead of creating endless products you don\u2019t want, we work with you to design collections that are made to last.Before Yes Friends even had a name, we started with a poll. One hundred people put their ideas into one mahusive hat and told us about their favourite T-shirts. We then set about making that T-shirt. We're here to make clothes you'll love for years to come.Since then, thousands of you have had your say on what styles and colours you want us to make next. On our collection pages you\u2019ll find our latest ideas and can have your say. Together, we're building the hottest collection of sustainable and ethical clothing on the internet.

        "Country/region Country/region ABOUT US Terra Thread\u00ae backpacks, bags and apparel are created for conscious consumers, corporations and NGOs who are looking to make a positive impact on the world with their purchase. Terra Thread puts people and the planet first, every step of the way from organic farms to your arms. Our Mission Redesigning fashion so that it empowers farmers, rebuilds soils, pays workers fairly, and reduces plastic waste in the world. Our Vision To lead a transformation in regenerative organic cotton farming to heal our planet. TERRA THREAD\u00ae was founded by father-daughter duo Vik and Vizan Giri who, astounded by the effects of fast fashion, were inspired to create a product that could have a long-lasting positive impact on the planet.\u00a0In 2009, Vik founded Gallant International Inc., a B Corp Certified company that supplies businesses with sustainable promotional and retail products. Gallant International is also Terra Thread's parent company. Throughout college, Vizan worked for Gallant. Her passion for social and environmental justice, coupled with the realization that there was an almost total lack of sustainably-produced backpacks and bags in the market, led to Terra Thread. Nearly all backpacks and most bags available in the market are made of synthetic fabrics such as polyester, nylon and other plastic-based materials. These synthetic-based bags deplete our natural resources and have a detrimental impact on human lives and the ecosystem during their production, usage and even post-usage. To solve this problem, Terra Thread crafted bags that are made using 100% organic cotton canvas grown by smallholder and tribal families in India who primarily depend on rain-fed agriculture. This means good for both people and the planet. As an immigrant from Nepal, Vizan has always been connected to South Asia. When the duo started Terra Thread, Vizan was able to connect further with her heritage as all the cotton is sourced from organic cotton farms in India, and the bags are made in a Fair Trade Certified\u2122\u00a0factory in India as well. Between Gallant\u2019s business practices and trips to visit farmers and factory workers in India, she gained first-hand experience of what it means for a company to take responsibility for their supply chains, as well as the growing demand and need for ethical products.\u00a0 Having experienced food paucity himself, co-founder Vik is also passionate about tackling the wider issue of food insecurity, and both Gallant and Terra Thread have joined Feeding America\u2019s campaign to end hunger in the United States.\u00a0 Terra Thread is a sustainable bag and apparel brand with a mission; to lead a transformation in organic cotton farming, and give consumers better, more planet-friendly choices for everyday essentials.Created for environmentally conscious consumers and designed to last, Terra Thread believes that great backpacks shouldn\u2019t cost the Earth. Recognized by Forbes, Newsweek, TreeHugger and The Good Trade as one of the most sustainable bags on the market, we have sustainability built into our bags at every stage of production. That means fair pay for farmers as well as workers and no toxic chemicals, no synthetic fibers, and no unnecessary packaging. Working directly with organic cotton farmers in India, we\u2019ve gone to every length to ensure that from start to finish our bags are being made in factories that meet the highest ethical and Fair Trade Standards. And because we want sustainable and ethical fashion to become the norm, we are committed to keeping our products affordable, making them as accessible as possible. \n                      Fairtrade Organic Cotton\n                     Terra Thread products are made using Fairtrade Certified Organic Cotton. Fairtrade Organic cotton ensures that farmers have access to safe working environments, gender equality, are paid a fair price for their cotton, and a Fairtrade Premium, among other benefits. Organic cotton is produced and certified to organic agricultural standards and is free of toxic chemicals such as pesticides and insecticides as well as GMOs. Fairtrade organic cotton practices and production sustain: Soil health, Eco-system preservation, Wildlife health, and Well-being of people. Learn about Fairtrade Organic Cotton HERE. \n                      GOTS Certified\n                     Terra Thread products are GOTS Certified. GOTS certification is a stringent voluntary global standard for the entire post-harvest process such as spinning, knitting, weaving, dyeing, and manufacturing of apparel and home textiles made with organic fiber. The standard prohibits the use of toxic chemicals during the processing stages and includes strong labor provisions as well a prohibition on child labor. The GOTS symbol means the products have met strict environmental and social criteria during processing along the entire supply chain.

Fair Trade Factory Certification ensures that our factory workers have access to a safe, democratic working environment, gender equality, are paid legal and fair wages, and a Fair Trade premium, among other benefits.

It's a nice fairly slim fit, medium thickness fabric, and all great cotton! Between the pullover and zipper hoodies, I have 6 of them! Thanks Terra Thread! This is thick and feels like excellent quality. Good length - hits me at the upper hips (I'm 5'8\"). Size runs on the slightly smaller side. Great color and very comfortable. Very soft and comfortable. Like that it\u2019s GOTS certified and regenerative. I went up a size because I think it runs a little small. I ordered three items from Terra Thread. It was my first time buying from them. I was impressed by their fair prices and took a chance. I must say the quality of their products is top notch!! The items were beautifully packaged and arrived quickly. I will be buying from this company again. Thank you Terra Thread. Explore Explore Let's Stay in Touch  Country/region \n\n\n",

        "Country/region Country/region FAIRTRADE ORGANIC COTTON All Terra Thread\u00a0products are made with Fairtrade certified organic cotton. This natural and biodegradable fiber is the better alternative to the harmful synthetic fibers that dominate the fast fashion industry.\u00a0 Cotton is everywhere. You can find products made with cotton in several everyday goods - your clothes, bedsheets, furniture, and much more. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), \u201cCotton is one of the most important textile fibers in the world, averaging about 25 percent of total world fiber use.\u201d According to Fairtrade International, around 100 million rural households are engaged in cotton production in more than 75 countries around the globe. In the hopes of increasing yields and income, farmers often turn to Genetically Modified Seeds (GMOs). In reality, \u201cthey are tied into buying expensive seeds and pesticides each year from multinational companies amid concerns that yields actually decline after initial gains.\u201d This is not the only problem associated with conventionally grown cotton. In fact, the United States Department of Labor reported that child and forced labor in cotton production is prevalent in at least 17 countries. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cotton out there, but when you opt for Fairtrade cotton goods you are empowering small-scale farmers and pushing the industry to become sustainable.\u201d The Fairtrade Minimum Price is the minimum that producers are paid when selling their products through Fairtrade. This covers the average costs of sustainably producing their goods and acts as a safety net when market prices drop. Producers can get the market price when this is higher and can always negotiate for more. The Fairtrade Premium is an extra sum of money in addition to\u00a0the selling price that farmers or workers receive to invest in their communities. Representatives elected by locals decide how to spend theFairtrade Premium.\u00a0These investments include projects like improving their farming, businesses, or health and education in the community. The Fairtrade Standards are the requirements that producers and the businesses who buy their goods have to meet for a product to be Fairtrade certified. These standards ensure fairer terms of trade between farmers and buyers, protect workers\u2019 rights, and provide the framework for producers to build thriving, sustainable farms and organizations.

Our products meet GOTS\u2019 strict social and environmental criteria across the entire supply chain, including adherence to strong labor provisions and prohibited use of toxic chemicals. Simply put, organic cotton is grown without toxic pesticides or insecticides and that is what makes it different from others. Conventionally grown cotton is sprayed with numerous chemicals that soak into the plant and the surrounding soil, which is then ingested by the farmers. When pesticides are sprayed, toxic runoff takes place, which causes toxic chemicals seep into our drinking water supply, rivers, lakes, and other sensitive ecosystems. Long-term exposure to these chemicals can be detrimental to people's health and can have major impacts on their lives and well-being. Research shows that conventionally grown cotton uses more insecticides than any other crop in the world. According to\u00a0Organic Trade Association (OTA), cotton used $4.2 billion worth of pesticides in 2017, accounting for 6.35% by value of all the plant protection chemicals sold that year, including 12.34% of all insecticide sales and 3.94% of herbicide sales. The standard prohibits the use of toxic chemicals during the processing stages and includes strong labor provisions as well as prohibition of child labor. GOTS covers the processing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, trading, and distribution of products sold as GOTS certified. When you purchase a GOTS Certified product, it means that the product has met strict environmental and social criteria during its entire supply chain. Social criteria based on the key norms of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) must be met by all processors and manufacturers. They must have a social compliance management with defined elements in place to ensure that the social criteria can be met. For adequate implementation and assessment of the following social criteria topics the listed applicable key conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) have to be taken as the relevant basis for interpretation.

        "Country/region Country/region REGENERATIVE ORGANIC CERTIFIED\u00ae In 2022, we took a big step forward. We became a ROC certified brand. It\u2019s the largest ROC cotton project of its kind in the world.  Working with our factory partners and growers, we\u2019ve been able to get over 700 farms ROC certified. These farms span across 3500 acres in India, which is one of the largest growers of cotton in the world.  If we\u2019re going to bring more traceability and equity to cotton, we need a certification that combines environmental and social impact under one umbrella.  For our farmers in Orissa and Telangana, who are dealing with climate change, increased periods of heat, building farms that are resilient, filled with nutrient-rich soils, and self-sufficient is imperative. It\u2019s not a dream of the future, but a need of the hour. We\u2019re glad that we can play a small role in guiding the organiccotton movement in India to a regenerative one. Today, our clothing line\u2013 t-shirts, pullover hoodies and zip-up hoodies, are entirely made of Regenerative Organic Certified\u00ae cotton.\u202f Regenerative Organic Certified\u00ae (ROC\u2122) is the highest standard for organic agriculture in the world, and the only certificate with stringent requirements for soil health, animal welfare, and the social wellbeing of farmers and workers. Regenerative Organic Certified\u00ae is overseen by the nonprofit Regenerative Organic Alliance (ROA), which was founded by the Rodale Institute, Dr. Bronner\u2019s and Patagonia.  Regenerative Organic Certified\u00ae certifies food, textiles, and personal care products with the highest standards. Its foundation builds on USDA Certified Organic standards while incorporating other vital benchmarks that combine the principal components of regenerative organic farming.\u202f \u00a0 Each pillar calls for a different quantity and range of organic and regenerative methods. To keep the accreditation, farms and businesses must upgrade their levels (from bronze to silver to gold) over time. The ROC\u2122 assures that products have adhered to stricter criteria than normal USDA organic requirements in terms of soil health, animal welfare, and fairness to farm workers.\u202f\u00a0 How We Can Heal People and the Planet with Regenerative Organic Agriculture  - Rodale Institute  Explore Explore Let's Stay in Touch  Country/region \n\n\n",

I\u2019m a grad student and normally use a backpack to carry all my school stuff (laptop, books, water, pencils, etc) but recently I\u2019ve been studying at local coffee shops and preferred to carry my things in a tote bag. This bag has been great!

I usually use the back pocket to carry an extra bag for groceries or my phone while I\u2019m walking. I only wish this bag had a zipper for the main compartment. The lavender color is also kind of blue-purple, but I really like it. I ordered 5 executive tote bags for the girls in my family for Christmas. I know they will love the quality and size. They are sturdy and can easily hold laptops and much more. They have a wide range of colors but I was conservative going with Charcoal and Black which I\u2019m sure they will like.

        "Country/region Country/region Earth Day is much more than one day on the calendar; it is a time for us to share a moment collectively and think about our planet. It is a wonderful opportunity to announce WE CARE. You might be wondering, \u2018When is Earth Day?\u2019 It's always on April 22nd. But knowing 'What day is Earth Day?' is not enough; it is crucial to understand why we need it. The idea for Earth Day started because people saw problems with our environment. Such issues like pollution and global warming still exist within society. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the organization confirmed that the year 2023 was the hottest year on record, with global temperatures exceeding averages by 1.45\u00b0C, emphasizing the necessity of tackling climate change. That's why Earth Day is CRITICAL. It serves as a reminder that any little steps taken by people, no matter how small, can go a long way toward a better planet. From tree planting and waste reduction to educating others, we all have our parts. In this blog post, we are going to discuss fun and engaging ways to celebrate Earth Day. We'll look at how we can celebrate Earth Day with things we can all do. These tips will inspire you, whether you are a teacher who wants to engage your students, a parent searching for fun \u201cEarth Day for kids\u201d activities, or simply someone interested in making a difference. Let\u2019s strive to make this Earth Day a special day. Earth Day is a day to focus on activities and learn about protecting the environment. It provides an opportunity to contemplate why the earth requires such profound care. This global event encourages individuals to reflect on the changes they can implement to impact the environment positively and improve their daily lives. Simple actions like reducing plastic use or actively participating in environmental initiatives are positive steps in the right direction. Earth Day reminds us that we all share the responsibility of keeping our planet healthy. Earth Day is an annual event that raises awareness about environmental issues. It started in 1970 when millions of Americans protested against pollution and demanded stronger environmental laws. Today, Earth Day is a big movement that brings people together from all over the world to teach, inspire, and encourage everyone to protect the planet. It has led to many progressive eco-friendly actions and important environmental legislation around the globe. Why do we observe Earth Day? The simple answer is that issues like global warming, deforestation, and pollution are endangering the Earth. Approximately 9.7 billion cigarette butts are discarded every year; 4 billion of those horrifically stay and poison the waterways, contributing to about 20% of all United States litter. On the other hand, various trees are planted all across the globe in different quantities, but the number being planted to the amount being consumed is drastically low. 10 million hectares worth of trees are consumed every year, while only half of that is replanted, resulting in negative forest population growth. Western Europe, previously rich in green landscapes with 80% covered in forests, now has just 34% left. Meanwhile, 460 million metric tons of plastic waste every year is astonishing. By the year 2050, there is a chance for plastic to outweigh fish, which would spell doomsday for ocean animals. Earth Day is a gift to the world for reevaluating how we solve various problems to ensure a better ecological future not just for today's society but also for generations to follow. It calls for attention and encourages people to take actions like afforestation, cleaning, waste management, passing laws on environmental protection, and many other activities that have a positive effect on climate and help the world we share. The more people participate, the more positive changes we will be able to achieve to ensure the well-being of future generations. In the absence of action and consequences, those issues will get more and more difficult to deal with, which in turn will destroy the air we breathe, the water we use for drinking, and the planet we live on. Earth Day serves as a reminder that we still have time to make a change\u2014IF WE ACT NOW.  Trees play a crucial role in cleaning the air, supporting wildlife, and creating healthier environments. Forests provide habitats for 80% of the world\u2019s land species, helping wildlife thrive. Urban reforestation can also improve mental health (studies indicate that office workers who see green spaces feel better). Trees even release phytoncides, natural compounds that reduce stress, boost immunity, and improve heart health. Plus, adding just 10% more green cover in cities can lower surface temperatures by 2.2\u00b0C, creating cooler and healthier spaces. Here are a few ways you can help: The term \u201cfast fashion\u201d has gained a lot of popularity lately, but its impact on the environment is a growing concern. A wonderful alternative to buying new clothes is organizing a clothing swap with loved ones. Here are 3 steps for a successful clothing swap: Earth Day is one of the best days of the year. On Earth Day, we can all set small promises that help our planet. The changes need not be drastic; even simple things in our day-to-day activities can help a lot. You can start small by reducing plastic/plastic product usage, using a reusable water bottle, or carrying a shopping bag. Another idea is to save water. Turn off the water tap after brushing your teeth, take shorter showers, and fix any leaks. If you use the car often, try going car-free once a week and walking, biking, or taking public transport. You can also lessen your carbon footprint by reducing meat consumption. Meat is one of the highest producers of GHG emissions, so even going a few days without eating animal products can be a great help. These steps may seem small when done by one person, but imagine the effect if we all did them. So, what\u2019s your eco-friendly promise this Earth Day? Recycling is one of the best things we can do to save the planet. But, unfortunately, the majority of us don\u2019t do it properly. Earth Day serves as a perfect reminder to change our habits, and having these tips can truly help make a difference. Let\u2019s make these small efforts collectively and enjoy a more sustainable future. Purchasing items from the supermarket requires significant transport logistics. During this transportation, the environment suffers from an increased carbon footprint. When possible, opt for locally-grown food. It aids local economies, supports farmers, and decreases transportation-related emissions. Buy only what you need and compost the rest of your food scraps. Choosing local food is an incredibly effective way to support your community while celebrating Earth Day. Organizing a community clean-up is one of the most powerful ways to celebrate Earth Day while also making a visible difference. You can also educate other people around you about keeping public spaces clean and minimizing waste. It\u2019s rewarding to witness the results of your hard work! You can also partner with local schools, offices, or environmental groups to expand participation. Using fewer cars is great for the planet. However, we understand that going car-free is not always easy, especially in the U.S., where over 66% of Americans commute to work using their own cars. One solution is to encourage carpooling or the use of public transit when possible. Cars contribute to air pollution and climate change by emitting harmful gasses. Choosing sustainable transportation can significantly reduce your carbon footprint which makes a difference. You can participate in an eco-friendly way by: Get involved with local activists who make an effort to protect the environment. These groups focus on issues like pollution, deforestation, and climate change. Join them to become an environmental advocate and make a difference. Search for local organizations, businesses, or government offices sponsoring clean-up programs, tree planting exercises, or educational sessions. Attend their meetings, volunteer, or donate if you can. Promoting their activities on social media helps spread the word too! Support local activists to help work toward a greener and healthier planet. Plastic straws, cutlery, containers, and bags are easy to dispose of but leave enormous amounts of waste in their wake. Instead of disposable items, start using reusable ones, such as water bottles, bags, and even utensils. Refusing plastic straws or opting for an organic cotton tote bag bag can do wonders in decreasing plastic pollution. Many restaurants and cafes also offer incentives for customers who bring their containers. Zero-waste living benefits the earth and sets a good example for others to follow as well. With each effort made in avoiding single-use plastic disposables, our planet becomes cleaner and greener. Every voice counts! Take action by advocating for representatives to pass laws that protect nature and reduce pollution. Many governments are now focusing on sustainability, but stronger action is needed. With more public demand and pressure, it can lead to better laws and legislation surrounding climate change, waste management, and clean energy. Taking Earth Day into consideration for children is equally vital. Kids should start learning how to protect their environment at an early age. There are numerous Earth Day activities for kids that are both engaging and instructive. Simple lessons like how to recycle or conserve water can greatly impact creating a sustainable future.  For Earth Day, it's a great idea to teach kids how to care for the planet. Hands-on Earth Day Activities will facilitate children's learning about nature, sustainability, and recycling, all while enjoying themselves. These activities will enhance the spirit of Earth Day and make it special and productive, whether at home or in the classroom. Kids learn best through play, making it easier for them to grasp essential concepts about the environment. These games make Earth Day for kids more entertaining while imparting invaluable lessons about caring for the planet. Earth Day activities can also be done in a group setting, making them ideal for schools and families. These activities foster collaboration while promoting environmental stewardship.  Changing our daily habits in small ways can greatly help the environment. Implementing a few practices in our everyday lives can aid waste management, energy expenditure, and the preservation of our planet. Small changes may seem minor, but they add up to create a huge difference over time. Following Earth Day tips and making eco-friendly choices fosters a better future. Sustainable living is not a one-day activity\u2014it involves making an effort every day to protect the planet. All put together, small actions can form new habits. A little effort today goes a long way toward creating a healthy and green planet! \u201cEarth Day\u201d is an encouragement for us to factor in how every tiny action can collectively contribute to the protection of our precious planet. Using less plastic, conserving water, and planting more trees are simple yet impactful activities. On a larger scale, volunteering for community clean-ups or switching to environmentally sustainable brands to support eco-friendly companies reap even greater rewards. Let\u2019s make every day \u201cEarth Day\u201d with smarter choices. Ask your friends and family to join in and help take care of the Earth. You can share our Earth Day blog with others to inspire them too. Small efforts add up, and together, we can make the world a cleaner and greener place! Earth Day is celebrated on April 22 every year. Try planting a tree, starting a compost bin, or reducing your plastic use. Check out the ideas above, and if you're looking for something different, try hosting a zero-waste picnic, starting a neighborhood garden, or making DIY eco-friendly gifts. They can participate in clean-ups, learn about recycling, and do fun eco-friendly crafts. Plant trees, recycle, reduce plastic use, walk or bike instead of driving, clean up litter, support local farmers, save electricity, advocate for policies, use reusable items, and educate others. Every small action counts. Start with one sustainable habit! Leave a comment Please note, comments need to be approved before they are published.

        "Country/region Country/region Human conducts has left this crumbling boulder of a planet we name Home unhappy with apprehensions\u2014  Our precious Earth is highly dynamic, and the whole species of plants & animals are becoming extinct without humans having a chance to appreciate them. We\u2019ve invited industrial pollutants to invade the air, water bodies, food, medications, furnishings, textiles, businesses, and houses. Natural resources such as fresh water, fertile land, and forests are becoming depleted, destroyed, or harder to come by as a result of ever-growing consumer demands. As we face growing environmental challenges, embracing sustainable practices is more crucial than ever. Beyond the statistics, it\u2019s about protecting the heart of life itself: the songs of birds, the whisper of leaves, and the thriving beauty beneath the waves. Each of us has a role to play, and together, our collective actions can create a world that honors and cares for nature instead of depleting it. Let\u2019s make choices today that leave a lasting, positive impact for generations to come. \u00a0 Vote, but as an aware voter\u2014 educate yourself on the societal challenges and the candidates running for elections.  Are the leaders in your local neighborhood addressing climate change action as urgently as the general public? When campaign season arrives, have a good awareness of the ongoing community problems and the candidates who want your vote. Voting is a fundamental opportunity to bring changes\u2014 but you won't be able to exercise your authority effectively unless you\u2019re fully informed. Plan ahead of time to research how a vote in any single angle means for you and your community members. Your vote can drive high-level actions--- Become a member of a climate activist organization to encourage collective, mass movement. Changes at the government level can only be made if we, the citizens, demonstrate our commitment to environmental protection and empowerment. Research, educate yourself on global issues, discuss, read, and finally, make doubly sure you get out there and vote when it's your turn\u2014 the government impacts your life, and your vote makes a difference! Among the most significant New Year's Resolutions for most people is to eat healthy. We commit to changing our eating habits, only to find ourselves running in a circle year after year (of course, there are exceptions). So this year, why not stay true to it? Challenge yourself to eat more responsibly. To begin with, shop for products that are manufactured according to fair labor standards. This implies everything\u2014 from the smallest edible to the largest. Look for the Fairtrade label on a product. If you\u2019re not sure, do your research about the ethical manufactures committed to sustainability. And wherever possible buy locally or organically grown produce.  Speaking of \u2018possible\u2019\u2014 restrict your meat consumption if at all possible. The cattle sector is a huge cause of pollution, and most traditional livestock are reared cruelly. If you consume meat every now and then, buy from local vendors who practice regenerative livestock farming. Ethical eating will not only\u00a0 establish healthier consumption habits but also induce a sense of belonging to the community. Charitable contributions are an excellent means to support numerous organizations all across the world fighting against hunger, diseases, and poverty. Commit to being efficient as possible when donating to your choice of organization in 2022. Do your homework\u2014 find out which charity/ non-profit organizations are making a real difference in the world. You can support them in their quest to make the world a better place by donating your dollars. The world uses 160,000 plastic bags per second\u2014 just for about 12 minutes on average. That\u2019s 100 million tons or more of plastic trash in one year. In the meantime, plastics have a landfill lifespan of around 1,000 years, which is highly problematic for the world.  So what can you do about it in 2022? Commit to carrying reusable cotton tote. Really\u2014 it\u2019s as simple as that! As part of your New Year\u2019s resolutions, you can also challenge yourself to go a day without plastic and then eventually increase the days. While it can be tough to suddenly ditch the single-use plastics we are accustomed to for most of our lives, taking such drastic steps opens our eyes to the severity of the plastic crisis. The biggest takeaway is that once we eventually start living our days without single-use plastics, we begin to understand how we can, once and for all, stop them from playing any part in our lives. We buy fast fashion clothes significantly more than we need (and use), only to discard them. Every year, an estimated 92 million tonnes of textile waste gets generated\u2014 comparable to a garbage truck filled with garments ending up in landfills per second.  In this coming new year, resolve not to buy or buy into fast fashion. Alternatively, consider sustainably made textile products including organic cotton canvas backpack, bed sheets, t-shirts and more. They are eco-friendly, sustainable, and safer for the health\u2014 free of chemicals and pesticides. This also helps prevent perfectly wonderful apparel from ending up in landfills. The fast fashion industry is extremely polluted, resource-intensive, unsustainable, and inequitable\u2014 take a vow to make your new year free of fast fashion. Sustainability is not just a trend; it\u2019s a lifestyle choice that can significantly impact our planet for the better. This year, let\u2019s challenge ourselves to rethink the way we shop, wear, and consume. Prioritize buying less but better. Opt for timeless wardrobe pieces that last longer and don\u2019t go out of style. Embrace second-hand shopping or clothing swaps, which not only save money but also reduce waste. Additionally, look into brands that practice ethical manufacturing, use recycled materials, and pay fair wages to workers. Be curious\u2014 ask questions about the origin of your clothing and whether it aligns with your values. Sustainable fashion is more than avoiding fast fashion; it\u2019s about celebrating creativity while respecting the environment and human rights. Each purchase you make is a vote for the kind of world you want to live in. Make it count by turning your wardrobe into a statement of care and responsibility. We need to proactively combat the repercussions of climate change. Living on the hopes that leaders will take action to fight the climate issues is not enough to reverse climate change. We, as responsible citizens, should do it for ourselves by committing to reduce our carbon footprint in 2022. And you can start with reducing meat consumption, walking and biking, taking public transit when possible, and making an effort to live and consume the minimalist way in every part of our lives. You don't necessarily have to take a worldwide approach when deciding how to leave a positive mark in the world. Every little effort you undertake contributes greatly to long-term changes. The most important resolution you can adopt in the new year is striving to take conscious decisions\u2014 decisions that serve the greater good. Remember that every significant change starts with a little individual effort. Never discount your power as a global citizen\u2014 harness it to help the world transform visions into reality in 2025!

        "Design is our passion, and using design to impact lives has become our purpose. Anchal is a non-profit social enterprise that leverages design and collaboration to create sustainable, income-generating careers in eco-friendly textiles for marginalized women in India. \u201cAnchal\u201d is a Hindi word meaning both shelter and the decorative edge of a sari used to provide comfort and protection to loved ones. Anchal provides valuable skills training in textile production and fair-wage employment to women.\u00a0 The holistic program includes education workshops, health services, and community benefits, fostering financial independence and creativity.  The artisans create award-wining handmade products that blend traditional techniques with eco-friendly methods, minimizing environmental impact and championing sustainability in the fashion industry. A human-centered design process balances the artisan\u2019s well-being and our customer's needs, resulting in beautiful artistry. When women have employment opportunities, they empower themselves and create generational change. Steadfast dedication to using eco-friendly materials and processes, combined with long-term community investment, ensures a positive impact. Collaborating with a trusted Indian NGO and manufacturer to lead operations builds trust and creates long-term impact. Anchal believes that sustainable impact is most successfully driven by local leadership. We partner with an established and trusted non-governmental organization (NGO) and a social enterprise that is dedicated to providing careers in textile production for marginalized and exploited communities of women in Rajasthan, India. The Indian organizations are the face of Anchal. They successfully run operations, artisan recruitment, training, production, and monitor impact. Their connection and dedication to the community provides deep knowledge, builds trust, and gives experienced guidance, thereby ensuring the program is informed by the artisans, meets their diverse needs, and fosters long-term impact. Anchal was established in 2010 by sisters Colleen and Maggie Clines. With backgrounds in architecture, they recognized the transformative power of design in addressing social and environmental issues.  Their journey began after Colleen's eye-opening experience with an NGO in India during a 2009 Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) graduate class trip, where she learned about the need for alternative livelihood programs for women in the sex trade. Meanwhile, Maggie explored the profound impact of design as a research assistant.  Motivated by their shared interests and passions, they raised $400 to start Anchal, providing the first collective of artisans with sewing machines, materials, and stipends. This marked the official establishment of Anchal as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in 2010, a status that underscores our commitment to transparency and accountability.",

        "Blending hand-crafted artistry with distinctive designs for clients around the world. Anchal excels in partnering with brands and designers to create unique collections that seamlessly blend artisanal craftsmanship with our distinctive design expertise, delivering a compelling story and product to our clients.  Our custom collaborations span a variety of industries, from home decor and fashion to hospitality and museum gift stores. We've proudly worked with esteemed clients such as Bloomingdale's, The Guggenheim Store, Madewell, Brooklinen, and Ace Hotels. Explore some of our favorite projects below. Anchal crafted a limited-edition organic cotton quilt exclusively for Bloomingdale\u2019s. Inspired by the storied tradition of Indian madras designs, the contemporary checkered pattern brought a modern twist to heritage. These exclusive quilts were showcased in 12 Bloomingdale\u2019s stores nationwide and also available online. For its second collaboration with the Guggenheim Museum Store, Anchal was invited to honor the works of Brooklyn-born artist Alex Katz through an exclusive, limited-edition capsule collection. Drawing inspiration from Katz\u2019s iconic use of bold color, refined compositions, and economy of line, the collection was influenced by his paintings The Red Smile and Yellow Tree 1. It featured an array of products, including quilts, tote bags, weekender bags, scarves, and quilted chore jackets. Anchal was commissioned to create custom textile art for Bunkhouse\u2019s Hotel Genevieve, drawing inspiration from Louisville, Kentucky's vernacular imagery. The piece\u2019s design is an abstracted steamboat wheel, crafted with\u00a0 a colorful array of patchworked panels embellished\u00a0 with kantha stitching. These vibrant framed artworks are showcased in 118 hotel rooms. Anchal created custom laundry bags for Maison de la Luz, Ace\u2019s luxury boutique hotel in the heart of New Orleans. Designed for both form and function, these bespoke items were crafted to complement the local art featured in each room, enhancing the hotel\u2019s unique aesthetic. In 2018, Anchal partnered with the Guggenheim Museum to design an exclusive capsule collection inspired by the modernist work of painter, Hilma af Klint. The named Spiral and Radial collection featured two quilts, scarves, tote bags, and a kimono jacket. These pieces incorporated abstract geometric forms and shades of brilliant color that exuded Hilma\u2019s powerful aesthetic. The Brooklinen x Anchal Collection was a limited edition of handcrafted, custom-made quilted bedding, throws, and pillows, exclusively designed for the Brooklyn-based luxury linens company. This collection seamlessly blended Anchal's signature contemporary quilting techniques with Brooklinen's minimalist aesthetic, creating museum-worthy yet functional decor that combines calm and comfort. For the launch of Madewell's Fair Trade Certified collection of denim, in February 2019, they selected three of Anchal's organic-cotton quilt designs to decorate the store windows of 120+ stores across the United States and London. In conjunction with the window displays, our contemporary home goods and travel bags became available to Madewell customers via the company\u2019s website. Anchal partnered with CAUSEBOX (now Alltrue), a subscription box featuring socially conscious and sustainable goods, to design the exclusive Winter 2017 box. Drawing inspiration from our Naari quilt, we transformed its warm pattern into the perfect cozy design for the boxes. Anchal brought James Beard nominee Chef Ouita Michel's dream apron to life for Holly Hill Inn. This durable and comfortable apron features long strings for tying in the front and multiple pockets, including a chef\u2019s pocket embroidered with their beautiful bouquet garni design. In the Summer of 2019, we collaborated with IBU Movement to create a one-of-a-kind sustainable look. The ensemble included our first-ever hand-stitched dress and slide shoe with a coordinating shawl-collar jacket. All three pieces were designed in partnership with IBU\u2019s team and intricately hand-stitched from certified organic cotton by Anchal artisans. Urban Outfitters' Anchal x Urban Renewal 2013 Fall Collection featured an exclusive eleven-piece line of one-of-a-kind apparel, including jackets, dresses, tops, shorts, and skirts. Each piece incorporated elements of our hand-stitched Kantha quilts made from vintage saris. This collaboration uniquely fused design, fashion, craftsmanship, and women\u2019s empowerment into every garment. Developed in collaboration with actor America Ferrera following her visit to India for Nicholas Kristof\u2019s PBS documentary, Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide, the Didi Connection united women globally through the sales of 600 scarves. In India, women affectionately call each other \"didi,\" meaning sister in Hindi. By purchasing a unique Didi scarf, customers supported their Indian sisters. The campaign provided year-long funding for 15 artisans. Are you a brand or designer in search of a unique handcrafted product or collection? We would love to hear about your project and create a beautiful, personalized piece that reflects your identity and values. Please note that custom orders and projects are subject to minimums, design requirements, and production schedules.",

        "Anchal's holistic program provides textile and job training to women without prior textile experience, followed by full-time employment, educational workshops, health services, and reliable access to an international marketplace. This comprehensive approach addresses the multifaceted needs of marginalized women, supporting them in rediscovering confidence, independence, and creativity in a financially rewarding way with Anchal and beyond. The majority of women who join start with little to no experience in the textile industry. We offer free training in kantha embroidery, machine stitching, fabric cutting, and production coordination, alongside design instruction in color composition and creative expression. Once training is completed, we provide consistent, reliable work for women who join the program, along with salaried and leadership opportunities, offering continued advancement and lasting impact. Artisans have access to free annual health camps with medical check-ups, eye exams, and free glasses. Project Assistants receive ESIC medical coverage for themselves and their families, plus six months of paid maternity leave. We offer workshops in leadership, financial planning, women\u2019s health, self-defense, and stress management to the entire Anchal community, fostering community & confidence. Project Assistants receive Provident Fund, a government-backed savings and retirement fund. Both employers and employees make monthly matching contributions. Project Assistants receive 16 paid holidays and 14  paid personal days. Extended sickness and disability benefits are included through ESIC. Artisans have the opportunity to receive a performance-based annual cash award given during International Women\u2019s Day. Project Assistants are eligible for annual bonuses. Anchal sponsors an annual International Women\u2019s Day celebration, providing gifts for all women, and also special Diwali holiday gifts each year. We provide a safe space for women to\u00a0 share experiences, knowledge, and strength, creating an unmatched support system. This solidarity enables women to encourage each other, navigate obstacles, and inspire future generations to strive for gender equity. As a verified member of the Fair Trade Federation since 2014, Anchal participates in a third-party verification program that extensively reviews our business practices and holds us accountable for fair trade practices. Prompt and fair payment is one of nine principles in which we are evaluated, ensuring fairness in all transactions and upholds our commitment to their Principles and Code of Practice. Anchal supports women with diverse experience levels, providing flexibility for them to work according to their preferences or capacity. These opportunities range from promoted management and full-time staff at the workshop to 180 artisans working from home. Artisans craft intricate hand-stitched embroidered products from their homes, earning income while balancing family responsibilities. Compensation is based on a per-piece basis, calculated using an average per-inch stitching rate, ensuring an agreed-upon living wage endorsed by partner leadership. Piece compensation is paid via direct deposit into their personal bank accounts monthly. The full-time staff work daily at the workshop space, handling all aspects of production, from cutting fabric to machine stitching to quality control. Their salaries, set collectively by our partner leaders and staff, ensure a monthly living wage above minimum wage regulations, paid via direct deposit into their personal bank accounts. Anchal ensures prompt completion of purchase order payments within 15 days of receipt, a notable departure from industry standards of 60 to 90 days. Product prices encompass artisan wages, materials, project assistant assembly, overhead costs such as rent, electricity, and equipment, along with a percentage profit to foster the partner organization's growth. Since 2010, Anchal has fully committed to long-term impact within the community we collaborate with in Ajmer, India.  We ensure consistent purchase orders to meet the workshop\u2019s capacity for its full-time staff and overhead expenses, supported by access to a large international marketplace, enabling Anchal artisans to receive the deserved financial support.  This commitment allows Anchal to create sustainable impact, build trust, and evolve the program to fit changing community needs, emphasizing sustainable livelihoods to break the cycle of poverty and exploitation through long-term employment opportunities.",

        "Designing Change Stitch by Stitch Anchal\u2019s designs seamlessly blend traditional, handmade crafts with contemporary aesthetics and eco-friendly values, revolutionizing textiles for the modern home and wardrobe. We honor the past and embrace the sustainable fashion movement by hand-stitching and printing all of our products while using sustainably sourced materials such as vintage fabrics, certified organic cotton, and non-toxic dyes. The kantha stitch is a simple running stitch that serves both utilitarian and decorative purposes. In its most basic form, it holds multiple layers of fabric together. When used decoratively, it can overlap, meander, and fill shapes with intricate designs. Originating in West Bengal, the kantha stitch is a culturally significant art form in India, with roots tracing back to ancient times. At Anchal, we pride ourselves on offering the highest quality kantha stitching on the market. Our meticulous stitching is both thoughtful and precise, using luxurious embroidery thread to create the softest plush finish. We push the boundaries of contemporary kantha techniques by incorporating bold graphic motifs paired with a refined color palette, invoking a sense of casual sophistication. Patchwork involves sewing together small pieces of fabric to create a larger design. In India, patchwork has a rich history deeply intertwined with the country's textile traditions. Originally a practical technique to repurpose worn fabrics, it evolved into an artistic craft featuring bold colors, geometric patterns, and detailed embroidery, reflecting India's diverse cultural heritage and skilled craftsmanship. Anchal enhances these traditional methods with modern aesthetics, resulting in products that are both beautiful and meaningful. By using patchwork, Anchal not only showcases the artistry of the craft but also promotes sustainability by using organic cotton and repurposing fabric remnants into high-quality items. Block printing is a remarkable traditional craft where intricate designs are carved into wooden blocks and used to apply ink or dye onto fabric.  At Anchal, this art form and color mixing are performed by a women led team, an extraordinary accomplishment in a field traditionally dominated by men in India. This empowers women artisans to break barriers and thrive in a male-dominated industry. Our designs blend traditional motifs with simple geometric patterns, creating a balanced aesthetic that honors cultural heritage while offering contemporary appeal. Embroidery is the art of decorating fabric or other materials using a needle to apply thread. This craft involves various stitches to create detailed designs, patterns, and imagery on textiles. Anchal artisans, known for their expertise in this field, specialize in a running kantha stitch to create intricate and elaborate designs. To enhance their work, these artisans often incorporate other traditional stitching techniques such as cross-stitch, backstitch, and chain stitch. By combining these different methods, simple fabric transforms into a work of art with added texture, depth, and complexity. Who made your piece? Check the tag for the hand-sewn name of our talented artisan. Each artisan takes immense pride in this personal touch and the intricate craftsmanship stitched into every piece.  Senior Artisan Neetu expressed, \"I know that I will never be able to travel the world, but now my name will!\" When you choose Anchal products made with organic cotton, recycled materials, and non-toxic dyes it is an eco-friendly and responsible choice that reduces harmful chemical use, conserves water, minimizes pollution, decreases waste, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. We proudly source vintage cotton and silk saris that we then\u00a0upcycle into a variety of  one-of-a-kind textile pieces. This practice helps minimize the environmental impact of textile production by reducing fabric waste and conserving resources. It also preserves cultural heritage by keeping traditional patterns and prints in use through kantha quilting. All new fabric Anchal sources is certified organic cotton. This sustainable farming technique reduces water consumption, supports soil health and is grown without harmful pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. By avoiding toxic chemicals, organic cotton promotes safer working conditions and ensures healthier end products. Additionally, its use helps minimize the carbon footprint of textile production, contributing to a more environmentally friendly and ethical fashion industry. We use non-toxic dyes, free from harmful chemicals like AZO compounds, to ensure environmental sustainability and consumer safety. This practice not only reduces the ecological footprint of textile production by minimizing water pollution but protects consumers from potential allergic reactions, skin sensitivities, or other prolonged health issues associated with conventional dyes.  We prioritize minimal waste in our product design, utilizing fabric scraps from our production to create new, useful items, effectively upcycling hundreds of pounds of fabric. Embracing zero waste principles, Anchal not only reduces landfill waste but also conserves resources and promotes sustainable consumption practices in the textile industry. Anchal\u2019s designs draw inspiration from India\u2019s rich vernacular architecture, heritage artwork, and the unique perspectives of the artisans. Guided by their creativity and the preferences of our customers, we sketch numerous designs and experiment with diverse patterns and colors. The Project Assistant team and artisans play a pivotal role in designing the vintage products by selecting impeccable color and pattern combinations that embody ultimate artistry. This collaborative process ensures each piece is meticulously crafted and uniquely created to complement your style.",

        "Your purchase transforms lives and supports sustainable futures. When you purchase an Anchal product, you directly support the woman who made it. Each artisan receives a living wage, verified by the Fair Trade Federation, which promotes her financial independence and journey of self-empowerment. Each purchase in turn supports her family's basic needs and children's education. This impact extends to the 180 artisans and 24 Project Assistants supported by Anchal\u2019s program.  \"Education is the most important thing in life. It opens doors of knowledge. If you can read and write, you feel strong. I will do anything to get my children the best education possible.\u00a0 I was the oldest of six siblings. My parents were extremely poor, and we could barely afford two square meals for the eight of us. My parents were out most of the time working as daily wage construction laborers and I had to look after my little sisters and brother. I missed out on what many children consider normal childhood experiences, such as playing with friends and attending school. Instead, my days were filled with caregiving responsibilities and the constant worry about our next meal. What I have missed in my life, I am determined to make sure that my children get. Most importantly a good quality education! Thanks to my full-time job at Anchal, I can send my two daughters and one son to a private school. I am able to pay their school fees, uniforms, and books. My husband is also supportive of my big dream for our children, and I am grateful for that support. Many of my fellow artisan women struggle to get support from their families. Anchal and the leadership team provide great inspiration for me. There is\u00a0 a great atmosphere of equality and I finally feel respected and appreciated for what I do, and for who I am. It is so wonderful.\" Inadequate access to education and employment disproportionately affects impoverished\u00a0 women worldwide, often forcing them into exploitation. Research indicates that women given employment opportunities are 90% more likely than men to invest in crucial areas such as education, shelter, food, and health. Anchal measures our investment through economic growth, health access, children\u2019s education, leadership, and market access. Anchal\u2019s programs demonstrate that systematically addressing employment inequality empowers women to uplift themselves and contribute to positive change within their families and communities, leaving a lasting generational impact. Anchal artisans exemplify this transformation: Gulshan built her own home, Renu provided her family with safe drinking water, Shama covered her son\u2019s surgery expenses, and Neetu sent her daughters to college. It is clear that Anchal's artisans uplift themselves and foster positive, lasting change. \"I remember my life with a great deal of pain.\u00a0 My family circumstances led me to a very undignified life where daily abuse and exploitation were a daily experience.\u00a0 I was so sad. I was on the verge of a mental breakdown and often had thoughts of ending my life. Then everything got worse when I married. It was a marriage of compromise, and my husband was not sympathetic to my past or physical and mental health. Eventually, we had two wonderful children, but I could never provide the life for them that I wanted. Then, by chance, I came to know about the community mobilization drive to enroll women in a skill-building program called Anchal. I was so depressed that I did not even want to try anything but, with patience and a lot of affection, I was convinced to join. And that was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I joined Anchal. Walking into Anchal is something I look forward to every day. There is a very lively and positive atmosphere. I dress well, I am healthy and the same can be said for my family. Every day I work hard to make sure my children do not face the difficulties I have faced in life. There are good and bad people in this world and after spending most of my life with bad people, I have finally found good people. There is a different life out there for us all if we just try. I am so grateful and proud to say that I am a happy person today.\"",

        "Your wishlist is empty. Indigo denim is arguably the fabric we most associate with diverse textures. Today, the texture is primarily influenced by historical inspirations\u2014if one is familiar with the history of denim, that is. A significant factor affecting denim texture is the spinning method and the resulting yarn irregularities. Recently, we\u2019ve grown accustomed to the marble and salt-and-pepper textures reminiscent of the '80s and '90s. This era is historically linked to the advent of open-end spinning in the denim industry, which was primarily adopted for its cost-effective production methods. In contrast, ring-spinning harks back to denim\u2019s origins prior to the '70s, representing the heritage of denim (and textiles in general). Ring-spun yarns are inherently uneven, or slubby, with variations in length and prominence. When the slubbiness of the warp is prominent and the weaving density is favorable, it results in a vertical streakiness we refer to as \"streaky denim.\" This texture is deeply rooted in the early days of Nudie Jeans, still evident today when examining a well-worn pair of \"Dry Selvage.\" The streaky denim featured in some of our new products presents bold and pronounced textures that add character while directly referencing the early days of Nudie Jeans.

        "Your wishlist is empty. Polly Money always dreamed of playing London\u2019s O2 Arena, but she never imagined it would happen four times in one year while on tour with The 1975. Growing up in a musical household, Polly naturally gravitated toward music, inspired by her siblings and a love of R&B.A denim lover and our latest playlist curator, Polly\u2019s creative process is as thoughtful as her performances, and she thrives on the energy of a live audience. With heartfelt melodies and undeniable warmth, Polly Money is one to watch\u2014don\u2019t miss her next live set if you get the chance. What got you into music? My first memories of properly getting into music are from my family playing music all the time. Whether we were at home, in the car, on holiday, music was always one of the first things to be thought of. I\u2019m the youngest of four, and all my siblings played instruments, so I naturally started picking them up and singing too. I guess I just wanted to do what they were doing, and playing music always felt natural to me.Who (or what) are your influences, and how have they shaped your style of music and personal style? I\u2019m really inspired by art in general. When it comes to music I get obsessed with melody. I cut my teeth on R&B when I was a kid and that has certainly shaped how I sing and write melodies now.  In the past few years, I\u2019ve gotten more into film and use that as fuel for song subjects. Musicians that have inspired me more recently are ML Buch, Dijon, and Mk.Gee. To me their music sounds like being wrapped in a warm blanket and that\u2019s pretty much always how I want my music to sound. Absorbing what all these artists do has certainly helped shape my current sound. What's your relationship with your denims or denim in general? I am actually obsessed with clothes in general, especially denim. Finding the right pair of jeans that fit just right is like the most incredible feeling for me. If I feel good in what I\u2019m wearing\u2014on stage or in daily life\u2014everything else falls into place. Even the smell of denim gets me excited to wear it.  Can you describe your creative process when writing and composing music? I usually like to write melody, chords and lyrics pretty much all at the same time in chronological order. If I\u2019m writing over a beat that's been sent to me, I like to sit with it, looping it over and over to get a feel for where I want to take it and what the song will be about. How do you deal with creative blocks or moments of low inspiration? I try not to put too much pressure on myself if it\u2019s not happening that day. Breaks are key for me, and being outside, so I\u2019ll usually just take a walk, put on some music that inspires me and try again. I always think some distance from a song works too if you get stuck. It\u2019s hard to keep the creative tap constantly flowing so I make a real habit of keeping up with my hobbies so my time doesn\u2019t completely revolve around music and that really helps me.  How do you feel when you're performing live on stage? Performing live is my favourite thing to do. I reckon I\u2019m more confident on stage than in general life and I really thrive off that feeling. I feel at home when I\u2019m performing and get so much from seeing an audience having a good time. Do you have any rituals or routines before going on stage or starting a recording session? I\u2019ve always warmed up before any show or session. I\u2019ve done the same warm-up now for so long that it really calms me. No matter how big the show is, getting a quiet moment doing my warm-up completely sets me up. What\u2019s your idea behind your Curated by playlist? I wanted this playlist to feel like a winter Saturday in London. I split the playlist into five parts. It starts with a morning walk, into a cosy afternoon (Sade is like the ultimate cosy artist for me), we\u2019re then getting ready for a night out, we\u2019re in the club, and finally a few songs for the night bus home.

        "Your wishlist is empty. We\u2019re thrilled to bring back the Flare Glenn fit! Originally designed in 2001 by Maria Levin, one of Nudie Jeans\u2019 founders, Glenn was one of our very first fits. Back then, it was a bold and progressive design that quickly became a fan favorite, helping to shape the unique Nudie Jeans style. Now, 24 years later, Glenn still feels as fresh and exciting as ever, both in its fit and in what it represents for the brand. We couldn\u2019t be more excited to see it return, but grab yours fast\u2014it\u2019s only available in limited quantities! Born in 2001, Glenn is one of the very first designs created by Maria Levin for Nudie Jeans.  Born in 2001, Glenn is one of the very first designs created by Maria Levin for Nudie Jeans.  Glenn's reintroduction comes with a story\u2014a denim genes kind of story. Hannes Levin, son of founders Maria and Joakim, and a stand-up guy who regularly lends a helping hand, once strolled in wearing a pair of worn-in Flare Glenn's. Those Glenn's blew our minds\u2014literally, we stood there in silence, all thinking the same thing: these are a piece of Nudie Jeans history, showcasing exactly why we do what we do. Hannes, sensing our awe, likely broke the somewhat odd silence with a humble \"What's up?\" and, well, he had to part with his jeans for a while. Fast forward, and we're reintroducing Flare Glenn while also recreating the look of Hannes' jeans\u2014named \"Streaky Worn.\" These feature defined vertical slubbiness and a distinct crosshatch texture. The denim's hue leans towards a greenish-blue, while the abrasions tell their own story with a warmly dusty charm.Hannes (and Maria and Joakim), we owe you big time for not just the style, but for the Nudie Jeans legacy.

        "Your wishlist is empty. The aging of denim imparts unique stories onto each pair of jeans. As time passes, the jeans adapt and reflect the wear they are subjected to. Yet, this evolution isn't merely a transformation forced upon the fabric by the wearer; it also mirrors the craftsmanship and artistry invested in crafting the denim. In this article, we explore the differences between two of our most notable Japanese selvage denim fabrics \u2013 Dry Selvage and Dry Ace Selvage \u2013 highlighting their unique attributes and their impact on distinct aging properties.  Originating from Japan, a country celebrated for its century-old indigo dyeing heritage and a unique shift within its denim industry from utilitarian roots to artisanal craftsmanship, these denim fabrics embody a rich legacy of knowledge and meticulous skill. Dry Selvage, integral since our establishment in 2001, holds a significant place in the evolution of Nudie Jeans. On the other hand, Dry Ace Selvage, introduced in 2019, brings a distinct ruggedness. Both stand as a testament to the pinnacle of Japanese denim craftsmanship and represent two of the finest examples we have encountered.  At first glance, Dry Selvage and Dry Ace Selvage may appear akin in their raw forms \u2013 a commonality among many dry denim varieties. However, careful examination unveils nuances. The color of the warp yarns sets them apart. Dry Selvage exhibits a subtle greyish-green undertone, while Dry Ace Selvage boasts a deep blue shade tinged with red. This discrepancy arises from their dyeing methods. Dry Ace Selvage follows traditional practices with multiple dips in pure indigo dye, while Dry Selvage employs a modern approach involving black sulfur dye as a base, followed by multiple indigo dye dips. These subtle variations result in subtle color \"casts\" \u2013 redcast for Dry Ace Selvage and greencast for Dry Selvage.  Upon closer visual inspection, a distinction in the contrast between the indigo warp and undyed weft becomes evident in the two fabrics. Dry Ace Selvage showcases a slightly more irregular and pronounced display of the weft compared to Dry Selvage. This variation can be attributed, in part, to factors such as yarn thickness, yarn irregularities, and the interplay between these elements. A glance at the reverse side of the fabrics reveals an intriguing detail: the weft yarns exhibit distinct colors. The weft yarns of Dry Ace Selvage are pristine white, imparting a cleaner appearance, while those of Dry Selvage adopt a beige hue. This difference in weft yarn colors contributes to a moderated contrast between the warp and weft in Dry Selvage. Furthermore, the beige weft color influences the overall perception of Dry Selvage's color palette, enhancing its greyish-green undertones. Notably, the choice of beige for the Dry Selvage weft yarns draws inspiration from vintage denim crafted from naturally brown-hued cotton.When evaluating the tactile qualities of the fabrics \u2013 the sensations they evoke when held \u2013 a distinct contrast emerges. Dry Selvage imparts a pronounced stiffness and smoothness to the touch, while Dry Ace Selvage offers a slightly softer, thicker, and more texturally intricate feel. This difference in tactile experience can be attributed to the varying levels of starch applied to each fabric and the differences in yarn thickness and irregularities. The additional starch on Dry Selvage lends it the propensity to develop sharp creases. Conversely, Dry Ace Selvage utilizes coarser yarns in both warp and weft, woven under lower tension, resulting in a thicker and more substantial texture.  However, perhaps the most noteworthy divergence lies in the texturally irregular nature of Dry Ace Selvage, achieved through the incorporation of yarns with pronounced irregularities, commonly referred to as \"slubs.\" Slub is a distinctive characteristic of \"ring-spun\" yarns, a traditional spinning technique that holds historical significance in the context of selvage denim production. These slub irregularities were historically influenced by technological limitations, contributing to unique aesthetic qualities. In Dry Ace Selvage, slub thickness and length are notably more prominent and varied compared to Dry Selvage. This emphasis on irregularities imparts a rustic appearance to Dry Ace Selvage, reminiscent of denim from the turn of the 20th century.The interplay between the warp and weft yarns, along with the incorporation of slubs, creates a \"crosshatch\" texture in Dry Ace Selvage. On the other hand, Dry Selvage also features slub yarns but to a lesser degree. In Dry Selvage, the warp yarns exhibit longer and thicker slubs compared to the weft, resulting in a slightly streaky texture. The more uniform nature of Dry Selvage's yarns, coupled with its weaving process, contributes to its denseness and its ability to form pronounced creases. While many of the facets we've examined in the dry denim comparison may initially appear subtle and challenging to discern, the distinctive properties of the denim become increasingly apparent as the jeans age. The natural process of wear leads to abrasion that gradually removes indigo, exposure to sunlight causes indigo bleaching, and washing contributes to both abrasion and the removal of excess indigo, accompanied by slight shrinking and distortion of the denim. Each of these factors significantly influences the aging trajectory of the denim.  The ultimate outcome is contingent on variables such as how the jeans are worn, the frequency of washing, and the timing of the first wash.One of the most notable distinctions between Dry Selvage and Dry Ace Selvage lies in the pronounced contrast of wear marks exhibited by Dry Selvage. This contrast is a consequence of the dyeing technique, fabric construction, and the liberal application of starch. Wear marks, including honeycombs and whiskers, manifest as sharp and vivid. This characteristic remains evident throughout all phases of Dry Selvage's aging process. Conversely, Dry Ace Selvage also presents contrasting wear marks, albeit not as contrasting. Due to its lower starch content, somewhat greater thickness, and exclusive use of indigo dye, the wear marks on Dry Ace Selvage tend to exhibit less pronounced definition.  Upon closer examination, the pronounced yarn slub of Dry Ace Selvage contributes to a vibrant texture. When the jeans receive minimal or no washes, these slubs tend to be predominantly vertical. However, with an increased number of washes, the warp and weft undergo slight rearrangements, further enhancing the crosshatch texture. In contrast, Dry Selvage begins with thinner yet evident vertical slubs. While this vertical slub pattern persists, prolonged wear leads to reduced contrast. With more washes, both fabrics undergo minor alterations in the arrangement of warp and weft yarns, leading to a granular texture referred to as \u201csalt and pepper.\u201d This textural phenomenon arises from the interplay between warp and weft slubs \u2013 where thicker yarn sections intersect, they protrude from the fabric, while thinner sections cause the fabric to cave in, creating a three-dimensional surface. Consequently, dye loss occurs where the fabric protrudes, and dye retention happens where it caves in. This texture is predominantly visible where the denim experiences less abrasion. Due to disparities in yarn slub characteristics, Dry Ace Selvage exhibits a more rustic salt and pepper texture, while Dry Selvage showcases a more refined rendition.  Both Dry Selvage and Dry Ace Selvage offer exceptional aging qualities, each with its own unique appeal. Dry Selvage transforms with pronounced contrasts, evolving into a refined ring-spun character accompanied by muted blue hues. In contrast, Dry Ace Selvage ages gracefully, acquiring a rustic, slubby ring-spun character that gradually softens into brilliant blue tones. These Japanese denim marvels are remarkable in their own right, and their complementary attributes create a unique synergy. It's this synergy that makes us insist on offering them side by side.

The key feature that sets broken twill denim apart is its unique tactile quality\u2014its sturdy softness. This is achieved by modifying the twill weave and breaking the diagonal direction to create a tiny zig-zag pattern. This alteration not only adds visual interest but also reduces the fabric's inherent tension, resulting in a softer fabric compared to its right-hand twill counterpart. Unlike the more common right-hand twill denim, broken twill denim is more supple and soft, developing an almost brushed feel when washed.In today's market, denim can be made endlessly soft, often at the expense of longevity or aging properties.

        "Your wishlist is empty. While black denim has been a part of the denim landscape since the early 20th century, it wasn't until the 1980s that it achieved widespread popularity. This era played a significant role in the transformation of denim into the everyday fabric that it is today. In the midst of this transition, a new chapter in denim history began to unfold as dyeing mills adopted sulfur dyes as an alternative to indigo. This chapter was characterized by an exploration of various dyeing methods that would ultimately lay the foundation for the diverse range of denim colors we see today. Notably, this era paved the way for the popularity of black denim in particular and established the foundation for the black denim variations we offer today. A \"black denim\" that is subjected to over-dyeing after its weaving process. This involves a dual-stage dyeing method \u2013 initially, the warp yarns are dyed, followed by the weaving process and a subsequent dyeing step known as over-dyeing, which imparts color to the entire fabric. The end result is a fabric that is entirely black. We find that this type of black denim has a particularly well-balanced aging property which is why we use it on most of our pre-washed black jeans. / Black Overdyed Black Products / Black Overdyed Black Products Made from black yarn-dyed warp and weft yarns this denim comes out entirely black from the loom. Due to the exclusive use of yarn-dyed yarns, it inherently showcases vibrant aging attributes. Given its lack of overdyed treatment, it typically possesses a crisper texture \u2013 facilitating easier creasing and thereby yielding distinct wear marks. This characteristic renders it the most distinguished in terms of aging properties among the various black denim options. Due to its exceptional aging property, we use this construction on all our black selvage denim.  / Black-Black Yarn-Dyed products / Black-Black Yarn-Dyed products Made from undyed yarns and then dyed black, this denim yields a fully black fabric. Notably, this variant retains its black hue for an extended period, displaying resistance to fading from wear, washing, and pre-washing. We incorporate this denim option periodically, particularly to create pre-washed jeans with deep black tones and subtle wash effects. Everblack is a \"piece-dyed black denim,\" but it is dyed using reactive black dye which has far superior colorfastness properties compared to sulfur dyes. Everblack denim retains its color remarkably well even after extended wear and numerous washes, ensuring that the denim maintains its rich black hue over time.  / More Black Everblack / More Black Everblack This denim starts out as a \u201cindigo denim\u201d that is overdyed black after its woven. Hence it is similar to \u201cblack overdyed black denim\u201d with the distinction being that the base denim is initially indigo blue before overdyeing. This results in entirely black denim with a subtle cold cast \u2013 a faint bluish tint from the underlying indigo. Similarly to \u201cblack overdyed black denim\u201d, this type of denim has a well-balanced aging property. What distinguishes it from \u201cblack overdyed black denim\u201d is the way it ages into cold cast shades. In this process, jeans are typically sewn from undyed denim and then later garment dyed to achieve a black color. Depending on the desired result, the denim can be of various colors. For instance, indigo denim can be chosen, resulting in black jeans with a cold cast. Over time, with wear and washes, this cold cast transforms into blue-black hues. The dyeing at the garment stage also leads to puckering at seams and imparts a subdued black hue. We use this technique intermittently, as it effectively produces pre-washed jeans with a muted surface, a rich texture, and a gentle aging quality.  When the slubbiness of the warp is prominent and the weaving density is favorable, it results in a vertical streakiness we refer to as \"streaky denim.\" The key feature that sets broken twill denim apart is its unique tactile quality\u2014its sturdy softness. This is achieved by modifying the twill weave, breaking the diagonal direction to create a tiny zig-zag pattern.

This remarkable fabric, weighing 14.2 oz showcase a rustic texture and a deep, redcast indigo hue, is a true masterpiece. Crafted by the renowned Shinya Mills in Okayama, Japan, it exemplifies the art of perfecting selvage denim imperfections.\r\n\r\nThe story behind Dry Ace Selvage is as fascinating as the fabric itself. It all began with a vintage, unbranded pair of jeans believed to date back to the 1950s, discovered in a thrift store somewhere in the USA. These jeans displayed wear and significant fading, and most importantly an incredible texture. They made their way to Japan, where denim from the jeans was meticulously reverse-engineered in exhaustive detail.\r\n\r\nThe art of reverse engineering denim is a hallmark of the artisanal Japanese denim industry. Dry Ace Selvage is a remarkable example of this craft, as well as a testament to the unique collaborative approach sometimes employed for premium Japanese denim. The rather extreme slub yarns are spun by Yamachu Mengyo Co. Ltd. in Osaka. The warp yarns undergo an impressive 20 dips in pure indigo dye, resulting in a deeply saturated surface with a notably substantial undyed core, courtesy of Kaihara Co. Ltd. in Hiroshima. Finally, the fabric is masterfully woven under low tension on vintage shuttle looms by Shinya Mills in Okayama. The guiding principle here is \u2013 do what you do best \u2013 and the final product beautifully reflects the craftsmanship at each stage of the denim's creation.\r\n\r\nAce's distinctive character arises from its thick and highly irregular yarns, generous use of indigo, and low-tension weaving. These factors contribute to its appealingly rugged aging property. Over time, the dye rapidly abrades from the surface of the yarns, emphasizing their slub, particularly in the vertical direction. When, or if, the jeans are washed, the yarns slightly rearrange, reducing the vertical slub and transitioning to a rustic crosshatch texture with a coarse salt 'n pepper effect. Notably, the heavily saturated surface of the indigo yarns entails an extraordinary evolution. Washing initially causes the dye to bleed onto the white weft, increasing the depth of color. With successive washes, the indigo gradually fades into brighter brilliant blue hues while deeper tones are preserved at seams and folds.\r\n\r\nDue to its unparalleled aging property, Ace unquestionably stands as one of the finest Japanese selvage denims we have ever encountered. We are therefore very proud to offer it in Tuff Tony. Average emission of CO2 for producing this product.

Nestled in the western part of Lombardy, amidst the vibrancy of Milan and the scenic vineyards of Piemonte, Candiani draws inspiration from its rich surroundings. From this dynamic environment emerges the Twilight Selvage \u2014 a denim masterpiece that not only captivates with its aesthetics but also unfolds vintage properties that set it apart.\r\n\r\nNamed for its pure-indigo dyed warp yarns, the Twilight Selvage possesses a spectacularly brilliant super blue hue with a subtle redcast, reminiscent of the twilight skies where deep blues meet the warmth of the hidden sun. This vivid portrayal extends beyond its appearance; the Twilight Selvage ages gracefully due to the slightly irregular ring-spun yarns and the fabric's density. While beautiful in its dry state, the true wonder of the Twilight Selvage is, much like wine, enriched as it ages into vintage. Please enjoy responsibly.

Constructed from slubby ring-spun yarns, this denim features a subtle greencast hue resulting from the dyeing process, which utilizes sulfur black and indigo. As the denim ages, its slubby texture will develop distinctive salt and pepper as well as crosshatch effects. Over time, the subtle green tone of the denim will become more pronounced, enhanced by the inclusion of sulfur black to allow for high-contrast wear marks. Solid Ollie Dry Abyss is stunning in its dry state, but it will only become more beautiful as your life will design your jeans. \n\nFor optimal results, we recommend wearing our dry denim regularly for at least six months before the first wash.

After some wearing and washing, the yarns will interact and you'll reap the rewards that ring-spun and open-end yarns create - that typical 90s marbling effect. It's the combination of yarn-spinning methods that renders the marble texture. The built-in tension formed by the yarns gives the denim a puckering texture that becomes more pronounced with wearing and washing. \r\n\r\nMuch like the best Japanese denim, this Turkish denim, developed by Orta, is dyed in pure indigo to an almost black indigo tone. Like all pure indigo-dyed denim, this one ages to a clean, blue redcast tone. The initial deep tone will allow for some nice highs and lows as your pair approaches vintage denim status. Enjoy.

The Joobles are a lovable, huggable, wonderfully squishy bunch of organic cotton stuffed animals, ethically hand knit in small cooperatives throughout Peru and brought to life in the bilingual picture book\u00a0Meet the Joobles!\u00a0by award-winning children's author, Monica Brown. All of the good stuff, none of the bad. Just like Fair Indigo's clothing, our Joobles organic stuffed animals are made with pure Peruvian organic cotton - in this case Tanguis, a close cousin of famed Pima cotton, with a fiber thickness better suited for stuffed animals. No pesticides or harmful chemicals are used in the cotton. Earth-friendly. Kid-friendly. Learn more. All of our dyes are certified to the most stringent safety standards such as the Oeko-tex 100 standard. They're tested for literally hundreds dangerous substances like Azo colorants, formaldehyde, pentachlorophenol, cadmium, and nickel. Our dyes meet or exceed the US Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) regarding lead and the European Chemical Regulation (REACh). Artisans like Irma and Gabriel proudly knit our\u00a0Joobles collection. Prior to being hired, the couple lived in a shantytown outside of Lima where they had come from the countryside ten years earlier in search of a better life. The better life didn\u2019t come easily, but since being hired, they have upgraded their home two times and now live in a brick house in a neighborhood where both of their children can attend public school \u2013 something Irma said was her ultimate dream. She, nor Gabriel were never able to attend school in their village. Learn more. In addition to living wage jobs, we believe the key to transforming communities from poverty to prosperity is education.

        "sustainable - fairly made - forever in fashion free shipping every day After years in the apparel industry, a small group of us left our jobs determined to make a difference and to change the industry we grew up in. To build clothing that's timeless, of impeccable quality, and sustainably made. Sustainable not only for the planet, but for the human beings involved in your clothing's journey from the cotton farms to your closet. Instead of racing to the bottom, we're aspiring to the top. With premium-quality organic clothing that looks good, feels good, and does good. Yes, it's time to say good bye to cheap, disposable, fast fashion. For good. Why will your organic cotton clothing feel otherworldly soft right out of the bag and endure beautifully for years? Because we use the top 0.05% (not a typo) of cotton available. Softest and strongest aren't often used to describe a single fiber. Except when it's organic Peruvian Pima cotton. Ours is grown on two family farms and harvested with care by hand. Simply the best cotton you'll find anywhere on the planet.  See our cotton farms At Fair Indigo, we're inspired by the idea striving for less. A mindful, deliberate, and sane wardrobe that leans heavily on timeless pieces you'll go back to again and again, clutter-free. And that's precisely why we build in quality - from the cotton and dyes we select to the often rare extra processes we implement to create premium-quality apparel. Our designs are forever in fashion - pieces you'll love for years, with quality that ensures you can.  See our quality commitments Often when apparel brands talk about sustainability, they are talking about making clothing that respects the environment and its limited resources - something to be applauded for sure. But at Fair Indigo, it also means sustainable lives for the world's garment workers. Our artisans and operators in Peru are paid a fair and living wage and treated like family, giving them the means to a healthy, happy life.  Meet our friends in Peru The Fair Indigo Foundation is a non-profit organization whose mission is to improve educational opportunities for children in the Peruvian communities where our cotton is grown, our alpacas are herded, and our products are made. The Foundation is funded by donations and by the support of Fair Indigo, which covers 100% of administrative and fundraising costs. That means every penny donated goes directly to supporting schools, teachers, and kids.

        "sustainable - fairly made - forever in fashion free shipping every day You'll notice! Your t-shirt is born in this beautiful place - in the Andean highlands close to the Pacific coast, near Chiclayo, Peru. The farm above is one of two owned by husband and wife team, Javier and Elsa, along with their son Javier Jr who oversees the day-to-day operations of the farms. As smart business people, their other farm is located over 500 miles away in Pisco, which is on the opposite planting/harvesting calendar. So they have a harvest twice a year instead of once and hedge their bets against bad weather in one region or the other. Pima is an ELS (extra long staple) cotton. It's significantly softer, stronger, and longer-lasting that other cottons. It beautifully resists pilling, shrinking, and disintegrating in your laundry. It really, really does! If you love organic food, but hadn't given much thought to cotton, consider this: cotton occupies only 3% of the world's farmland, but it consumes an eye-popping 25% of all pesticides. Setting aside the fact that we probably don't want pesticides lurking in our clothes, cotton pesticides in particular are even stronger than many food crop pesticides and can cause grave damage to farmland and adjacent eco-systems. Cotton pesticide often sterilizes the soil, which encourages deforestation in the search for new farmland. It also leaches into ground water, rivers, and lakes, and poses a danger to farm workers.So when someone comments on your Fair Indigo Forever Tee, you can tell them it's made with the top 0.05% cotton in the world and you won't be exaggerating! Cotton is to Peru as ice is to Antarctica. Cotton fabrics and garments have been found in Incan and even pre-Incan ruins. (OK, we're not saying your tee will last that long, but...). Today, Peru is widely regarded as the best place on earth to grow cotton. And one of the very few places perfect for growing Pima cotton.All of our cotton is grown without the use of pesticides, much like the Incas did. Our farmers use time-honored techniques like crop rotation for soil health (they grow quinoa in the off season), natural irrigation, and \"intercropping\" (see Fun Fact below).Growing Pima cotton requires a very specific weather pattern; a short, wet planting season followed by a sunny warm growing season, but with temperatures never getting too cold or too hot. Peru's Andean midlands are ideal. Corn is a natural pesticide for organic cotton. Our farmers plant one stalk of corn at the end of each row of cotton - kind of like an end aisle display. The corn attracts precisely the right insects that prevent cotton pests. We are so impressed with the thoughtful planning and hard work that goes into trying to do the right thing! Pima cotton requires that farmers weed and harvest completely by hand because machines partially destroy the extra long fibers. Add in the unrelenting sun during the harvest season, and it's quite a hard day's work. We are so grateful for the partners who provide us with these incredibly soft building blocks for fashioning a perfect t-shirt.

        "sustainable - fairly made - forever in fashion free shipping every day The world is beginning to realize that cheap Fast Fashion is not sustainable. Not for the planet, not for the people who toil in garment factories, and, if you do the math, not even for your budget. A $15 tee you have to replace every 6 months adds up. That's why, at Fair Indigo we like to build quality in from the ground up. Specifically from the fertile Peruvian soil that produces organic Pima cotton - simply the best on earth. Because it's not only out-of-this-world soft, it also outlasts lesser cottons by years. Not many brands are willing to pay the premium for this quality. We are.And that's just the start. Thoughtful design details, a timeless 'forever in fashion' ethos, meticulous construction, the gentlest dyes, and a rare, but extremely beneficial process of washing fabric before it's cut - a step that keeps your garment from twisting, puckering, and warping in the dryer. This may all seem very old school. And in some ways, it is. But we also strive to be as innovative as we can in reducing our footprint - everything from from tag-free clothing to the latest software to help us reduce fabric scrap waste to biodegradable polybags.But innovation also must mean pricing in fairness for the long haul. No more disposable clothes. No more boom/bust, in-style/out-of-style mindset. No more fake full prices to set up 60% off sales. Because when clothing is made well, we can all do well - you, our small business, cotton farmers, garment workers, and the planet we all share.

        "sustainable - fairly made - forever in fashion free shipping every day Too often, the idea of sustainability treats human beings as afterthoughts. For us, they are front and center. If organic clothing is priced too good to be true, it's likely because the well-being of garment workers was overlooked. We pay our artisans and operators fairly and create a supportive work environment, providing the means to a healthy, happy life. It's the only way to build a truly SUSTAINABLE business. And a better world. Small family businesses are increasingly rare in apparel making, but wife and husband team Elsa and Javier stand apart as an exception. And as exceptionally inspiring. They grow their own organic Pima cotton, run their own small-batch sewing workshop in Lima, and serve as a hub for dozens of tiny knitting and sewing cooperatives that lift scores of Peru's poorest citizens out of poverty. Two other people instrumental in making it all happen are their son, Javier Jr and Patricia, their faithful employee of thirty years. Javier Jr manages the two thriving and growing organic cotton farms. Patricia performs the Herculean task of translating our technical clothing specifications from English to Spanish and is generally the oil that keeps all the parts of the enterprise moving. The development team takes our technical specifications and turns them into samples that are sent back to Madison, Wisconsin for us to review and approve. Everything from garment pattern making to color approval to dozens of other tiny things most people who wear clothes never think of. The pre-washed fabric for our organic clothing comes into their workshop where it is expertly cut by artisans like Jonny. Jonny started as an apprentice, demonstrated his incredible abilities and steady hand, and was promoted to lead cutter two years later. Unlike many apparel factories we've visited, the employees in Javier and Elsa's workshop have often been employed ten, fifteen, even twenty-plus years. It's a testament to the family atmosphere and the way workers are treated and fairly compensated for a hard day's work. We think it's extremely important to show up. And not just to factory showrooms as is common in the industry. But to get on the sewing floor, to understand, talk with, and share meals with the hourly workers who you and we rely on. They're a critical part of our success - the foundation of it, actually.

        "sustainable - fairly made - forever in fashion free shipping every day It starts with a handful of organic Pima cotton seeds. The same seeds that have been passed down and replanted through centuries dating back to the Inca Empire of Peru. Sixteen months later, having passed through at least 97 pairs of hands, and with plenty of good luck, the seeds are transformed into the finest t-shirt you'll ever own. Read on to learn about your t-shirt's journey from its humble origin on a family-owned cotton farm. Our non-GMO cotton seeds are saved from the previous season's ginning process. The two family-owned organic cotton farms in Chiclayo and Pisco, Peru are chemical free and healthy. We keep the soil thriving by practicing complimentary farming. That means in the off season the land is used to grow quinoa - a crop that's ideal to keep the soil balanced all year round with the right minerals and ph. The Incas knew this in ancient times and it still works today! Once the plants start growing, Mother Nature takes over for the most part. One farm's growing season is roughly November to April and the other April to November. Both get plenty of rain during the planting season and lots of sun during the growing season. In the case of unusually hot or dry weather, we use natural irrigation techniques to tap into snow melt runoff from the Andes Mountains. Panoramic video clip from our farm in Chiclyao Unlike lesser quality cottons, our premium organic Pima cotton is harvested entirely by hand. Not only is it more environmentally friendly, it also ensures the cotton fibers are not damaged by industrial harvesting machines which can tear the fibers. By keeping the cotton fibers fully intact, the garment will be noticeably smoother and softer and, importantly, stronger over time too. Quite simply, Pima cotton creates garments that will endure much longer. Depending on the timing of when it's needed for making yarns, the harvested cotton bolls are safely stored in facilities very close to the farms as they await the ginning process. This is our founder, Rob, in a storage facility housing a recent day's harvest in Chiclayo. Ginning is the process of separating the cotton fibers from the seeds and other parts of the plant. The cotton gin was invented in 1794 and revolutionized the production of cotton by vastly reducing the time spent on seed separation. The seeds are then gathered and sent back to the farm for planting the next season. The circle of life! This is the first step where the raw cotton is processed into a truly different form - yarns. Bales of cotton are strung through a series of machines that first straighten and smooth the cotton into thick string-like shapes called slivers (pronounced sly-vers). Then the fibers from the slivers are spun at up to 2500 revolutions per second and twisted together into our signature organic Pima cotton yarns. This process usually takes about 4 weeks to process an entire season's order. A typical short sleeve t-shirt has 5 pieces that are sewn together - the front, the back, 2 sleeves, and the neck trim. If the t-shirt comes in 5 sizes, there are 25 different puzzle pieces to cut out of a panel of fabric to make one run of t-shirts. How to arrange and cut those pieces most efficiently is an art and a science, with the goal being to waste as little fabric as possible. Our cutting engineer accomplishes this with a combination of software and years of experience. His final result tell us exactly how much fabric we need to make! The machines that knit the yarn into our signature organic fabrics look like something off of a space ship. The precision devices are synchronized to pass dozens of strands of yarns through a track of needles arranged on a cylinder. The needles tightly loop together the yarns resulting in an incredibly smooth and soft base fabric. You can see a short video clip of this machine here. Before adding color, we take this extra step of passing the fabric rolls through a gentle enzyme bath. These natural enzymes dissolve tiny stray hairs from the cotton fibers giving the fabric a noticeably smoother feeling. It's then thoroughly rinsed. The final fabric is as pure and natural as you'll find. In cases where a t-shirt will be offered in an undyed color, a portion is sent directly to the workshop for cutting. All of our dyes are certified to the most stringent safety standards such as the Oeko-tex 100 standard. They're tested for literally hundreds dangerous substances like Azo colorants, formaldehyde, pentachlorophenol, cadmium, and nickel. Our dyes meet or exceed the US Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) regarding lead and the European Chemical Regulation (REACh). This is one of the steps we take that sets our clothing apart. By washing the fabric before it's cut, we take out the vast majority of shrinking early. Not only does this prevent it from shrinking in your wash (very minimal with proper care), it also helps the seams stay smoother. When clothing makers skip this step (they usually do) the fabric puckers or curls around the seams. That's because the fabric shrinks more in the wash, but the seam threads don't. All the work that went into the jigsaw puzzle of planning the fabric pieces comes to fruition in our cutting workshop. Artisans like Jonny very carefully cut the pieces that will be sewn together. As many as 50 layers of fabric can be cut at one time. You can see a short video clip of Jonny at workhere. When most people think about making clothes, this is what they think about. Stitching the arm to the body, hemming the sleeves. Sitting at a sewing machine for a full workday is hard work. Julia and her husband Oscar own a 10-person workshop that has transformed the lives of neighbors who can now put their skills t work. Each of them deserves to be rewarded justly for their labor. We owe them such gratitude for literally putting shirts on our backs. Learn More As the clothing comes off the sewing line, it goes through a rigorous inspection. The inspectors check for things like fabric flaws, missed stitches, and stray threads. They also check garment measurements to ensure it's within tolerance of the specifications. Each piece of clothing gets a gentle hand steaming, is placed into our biodegradable polybags, and then packed into shipping cartons. This is often where unnecessary waste is added in the clothing industry. We made the conscious decision not to affix labels or hang tags to our garments. Daniel is smiling because this also makes his job much easier! You can read more about our environmentally friendly polybags here. The day the team has worked so hard to make happen is finally here! The fruits of their labor are transported to the Lima airport, flown into the United States, passed through a US Customs inspection, and transported to our partner warehouse in St Louis. Occasionally, and usually at non-ideal times, the shipment gets randomly pulled for an intensive US Customs inspection that can add a couple of weeks to the time. Once the cartons arrive at our warehouse, they are unpacked, the product is placed in bins, and a signal is sent to our website to tell it your t-shirt is ready! 16 months, at least 97 pairs of hands, and lots of TLC later, the shirts are ready for you to try on, hopefully fall in love with, and wear enthusiastically for years to come. The fair price you pay supports the supply chain of traditional organic farming, ethical fair trade production, and a small independent clothing brand. You can truly feel great about what you're wearing.

        "sustainable - fairly made - forever in fashion free shipping every day The Fair Indigo Foundation is a non-profit organization whose mission is to improve educational opportunities for children in the Peruvian communities where our cotton is grown, our alpacas are herded, and our products are made. The Foundation is funded by donations and by the support of Fair Indigo, which covers 100% of administrative and fundraising costs. That means every penny donated goes directly to supporting schools, teachers, and kids.  \nEvery penny of your contribution will be used toward paying teachers, buying books & computer equipment, and making improvements to school buildings and playgrounds. To say your generosity is appreciated is an enormous understatement. These kids, their families, and their communities have been literally transformed because of it.\n Though a $5 donation may seem like a modest gesture, it has done a world of good for our adopted schools in Peru. You can donate any amount above or be able to do so during your checkout process. The Manchay School started as a makeshift building funded by various local charities. The school combats urban poverty by serving the children of families living in one of the poorest unincorporated neighborhoods of the capital city of Lima. The Serapis School serves impoverished rural kids in this highlands community of northern Peru, near Cajamarca. The school was founded by Javier and Elsa \u2013 the family that grows our organic cotton and runs our fair trade workshops.

        "sustainable - fairly made - forever in fashion free shipping every day Our clothing generally falls in the mid range of fits compared to other brands. Unless otherwise noted as a\u00a0Slim Fit\u00a0or a\u00a0Relaxed Fit\u00a0(see more below), it's designed to be gently shaped through the waist. Choosing the right size is a combination of following our sizing guidelines while incorporating how you personally like your clothing to fit. As a starting point, you can use the size chart here (also accessible from any product page).\u00a0 If you are on the fence between sizes, we've found more people have had success choosing the smaller size. If you generally like your clothing to run on the roomier side, select the larger size. Our men's clothing is generally a classic fit. There's comfortable ease built in, but it's by no means oversized.\u00a0 Most of our clothing falls into the Gently Shaped fit category. You can see all the products within the below fit categories by clicking on the pictures. 1) On any product page, in the top left corner is a grey icon denoting the fit category. You can click on this icon to see all styles in that fit category. 2) Above the Size selection boxes is a link called Fit and Size Help. This will reference body measurements above, in some cases provide garment measurements, and call out any special fit information. 3) The What's My Size link allows you to provide information about your height and weight as well as sizes you wear from other brands. The information you provide helps us give you a best guess as to what size will work best for you.  Special note on sizing for 100% Cotton Leggings:  All-cotton leggings are nearly unheard of. While this is why ours are so popular, many people perceive them as running too large. That's because most leggings have a very high spandex content and therefore cling more tightly to the legs. Ours do not. We suggest sizing down from your normal size when buying our leggings for the first time, unless you prefer them to fit loosely. Fair Indigo clothing is made with organic Peruvian Pima cotton - simply the\u00a0best quality cotton\u00a0you'll find anywhere else. Those angelically soft and lustrous (but unusually strong!) cotton fibers are crafted into four main fabrics. \u00a0You may become a loyalist to one of them. Or discover there's a place for each in your sustainable capsule wardrobe. 1) On the top menu of our website, hover over Women and select Shop by Fabric.  On mobile devices, on the top select the \u2630 icon then the + sign next to Women. 2) On any product page, you can find the fabric content just above the price. Above the Size selection boxes, you'll find the specific fabric name with a link to see all styles in this fabric if you wish.

Featuring a flattering, slightly rounded V-Neck and versatile elbow-length sleeves making it perfect for any occasion. \n The Women's Organic 100% Cotton Elbow Sleeve V Neck Top is crafted from silky-soft cotton interlock, a unique fabric construction with ingenious 'mechanical stretch' - no need for spandex! Featuring a flattering, slightly rounded V-Neck and versatile elbow-length sleeves making it perfect for any occasion. \n Our signature\u00a0all-cotton interlock\u00a0Serena fabric is more substantial than our Eterna or Pura fabrics. Its ingenuity is its ability to stretch without spandex. This is called mechanical stretch, achieved by the meticulously designed structure of the yarns. The fabric is washed\u00a0before\u00a0it's cut and sewn, an uncommon but very beneficial step. It minimizes shrinking over time (when following care instructions) and also prevents puckering and twisting around seams that often happens in your dryer when sewing threads shrink but fabric doesn't. Serena is used on many of our dresses, our all-cotton leggings, and in our most luxurious t-shirts. True investment-quality fabric! Why will your organic cotton clothing feel otherworldly soft right out of the bag and endure beautifully for years? Because we use the top 0.05% (not a typo) of cotton available. Softest and strongest aren't often used to describe a single fiber. Except when it's organic Peruvian Pima cotton. Ours is grown on two family farms and harvested with care by hand. Simply the best cotton you'll find anywhere on the planet. All of our dyes are certified to the most stringent safety standards such as the Oeko-tex 100 standard. They're tested for literally hundreds of dangerous substances like Azo colorants, formaldehyde, pentachlorophenol, cadmium, and nickel. Our dyes meet or exceed the US Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) regarding lead and the European Chemical Regulation (REACh). You've probably heard the expression 'less is more.' At Fair Indigo, we're inspired by the idea striving for LESS. A saner wardrobe that makes use of timeless 'forever in fashion' pieces you'll go back to time and again. That's why we build in quality - from the cotton and dyes we select to the extra processes we implement to create a garment you'll love for years. Buy better, buy less, live fully. Often when apparel brands talk about sustainability, they are talking about making clothing that respects the environment and its limited resources - something to be applauded for sure. But at Fair Indigo, it also means sustainable lives for the world's garment workers. And a sustainable business model that prices clothing fairly, not too-good-to-be-true low (a signal the people were left out of the equation) nor artificially high to promote a future 70% off sale. It's time to move beyond fast fashion. For good. In addition to living wage jobs, we believe the key to transforming communities from poverty to prosperity is education.  The Fair Indigo Foundation funds teachers' salaries, books, building improvements, and computer labs for children who otherwise were being left behind. Learn more.

Just wonderful in every way, especially happy they don't cling.\" - Jess As far as we're aware, Fair Indigo is the only place on earth where you can buy 100% cotton leggings. Bonus! Ours are made from the very best cotton on earth - organic Pima cotton from Peru.You will notice immediately that our leggings feel dreamy soft, and they do not cling like your typical synthetic leggings. All-cotton leggings will stretch as you wear them, but the fabric recovers with washing and drying.  Many customers choose to size down because our leggings have a looser fit.While our all-cotton leggings are not designed for intense athletic activity, they are perfect for your favorite low-impact sport and with proper care will endure beautifully. Why will your organic cotton leggings feel otherworldly soft right out of the bag and endure beautifully for years? Because we use the top 0.05% (not a typo) of cotton available. Softest and strongest aren't often used to describe a single fiber. Except when it's organic Peruvian Pima cotton. Ours is grown on two family farms and harvested with care by hand. Simply the best cotton you'll find anywhere on the planet.

        "When designing our garments, we begin with the end in mind. For that reason, ReCreate clothing is fully circular. Our circularity model begins with conscious design. We only use quality organic and natural fabrics, and eliminate all convenience items such as zippers and trims that are difficult to recycle.\u00a0 The next step is to ReLove and RePair wherever possible \u2014 giving our clothing a second life with a new home, or some thoughtful mending. Once a garment finally reaches the end of its life, we ReCycle. Through our partnership with Circular Cotton, returned garments go through a\u00a0fibre-to-fibre, chemical recycling process where old cotton is shredded, made into a pulp and then fed back into the textile production chain. This\u00a0fabric is\u00a0then\u00a0used\u00a0again to make new clothing \u2014 closing the loop on the garment industry. By joining us on our circularity journey, you ensure the softest possible footprint from the life of your garment \u2014 protecting our planet and those who live on it. If you\u2019re no longer in love with your ReCreate garment but it\u2019s still in great condition, send it our way and we\u2019ll assess it for resale on our website. If your garment is accepted, you\u2019ll receive an online store credit for up to 25% of the original price of your garment. Something gone wrong? If your ReCreate garment has been damaged or needs repair, simply get in touch and we\u2019ll help you find a solution to extend its life. We are happy to suggest mending techniques or arrange repairs on behalf.  For when it\u2019s really the end... If your ReCreate garment is beyond repair, send it back to us and we\u2019ll recycle it into new fabric through our partnership with Circular Cotton.

        "ReCreate operates in partnership as a New Zealand Registered Charitable Trust, with the vision of transforming lives through fashion. Every year we commit 100% of our profits towards empowering the most marginalised people in the Cambodian communities where our clothing is made. Since 2013, our sewing workshop in Cambodia has trained students in the complete garment production process \u2014 from design and pattern-making through to sewing a professionally finished garment. Throughout this process they are paid a wage to support themselves and their families as they learn, and are provided with the same employment benefits as our fully qualified team members. We also aim to empower each student through additional training in areas such as literacy and money management. We also have a long-term partnership with a Cambodia Registered NGO (non-profit organisation) to provide a range of community initiatives that support marginalised people. These include:\u2014  Child and family support through food assistance, children's programmes and social support\u00a0\u2014  School sponsorship through the provision of uniforms, stationery and school fees\u00a0to university level\u2014  Medical assistance through pregnancy and birth, illness and injury, hospital stays and community medical clinics\u2014  Community development through the construction of wells for drinking water and homes for people in need Your purchase creates positive change in the life of the person who made your garment!

It is a light and airy space on the top floor of a building \u2014 on the two floors below, our partnering non-profit organisation hosts medical clinics, children\u2019s programmes and community meetings. It is a source of life, fun and constant activity. At the heart of ReCreate we want to see lives transformed. That\u2019s why the journey begins with full sewing training \u2014 so that each person can gain a lifelong skill to carry with them wherever they go. Training is available regardless of background or previous experience, with many of our team members having never completed a school education. A wage is paid so that students can support themselves and their family as they learn. We are committed to providing fair and empowering employment to our sewing team. This includes living wages with the opportunity to earn matched savings every month, a 32.5 hour work week to ensure plenty of time for life outside of work, and paid holidays, sick leave, maternity leave and overtime. We are committed to supporting the individual journey of each person, whether this means the freedom to care for babies and young children on site, resources to send older children to school, or training in areas such as literacy and money management.

Ripple Tee | Black I love my new top! It\u2019s such a classic design and goes with so many outfits. Feels good to know that I\u2019m supporting an awesome brand when I wear it. Friday Top | Black It was love at first sight! Great dress up/dress down shirt with beautiful back detailing. Oversize fit (as per description) was what I wanted however if you wanted a more 'fitted' look, I'd recommend to size down. Found Shirt | Chalk The quality is just beautiful, as is the fit. This is a very versatile jacket that easily goes with dresses as much as jeans. Dress up or dress down - I can see myself getting a lot of wear out of this piece.

        "Every garment empowers its maker \u2661 Naturally dyed, hand-crafted garments \u2014 valuing people and planet ReCreate exists to transform the lives of our makers through fair and purposeful employment, individual training and care. This tee will last season after season - the quality is amazing. The material is so thick and is just such a versatile piece in my wardrobe with its boxy fit. Joy Sweatshirt Tee | Natural Love love love this dress!! Beautiful thick that washes well. Cut and style is fab. Especially love the button detail at the back that pulls the waist in. Easy to wear. Looking forward to wearing across all seasons. River Denim Dress | Black I was so excited when I found the Joy Tee. I have never been able to wear a simple tee before and always struggled over the summer months. The joy tee has definitely brought me JOY! Perfect length in the arms to cover the bits I don\u2019t like, and it doesn\u2019t cling to my waist, but floats beautifully. I now have 2 of them! Joy Tee | Black The dress is well made and the fabric is stunning. It fits well and I feel proud to have supported a New Zealand based company. Array Dress | Daisy Check I'm very happy with how well this top sits and fits, the quality of the fabric and the obvious skill in the design and manufacture. Voyage Top | Khaki Love! I have every colour now. Thank you. Cabin Pant | Soft Navy Best beanie I\u2019ve ever owned. I have not been able to find a pure cotton beanie, it\u2019s always nasty acrylic and polyester which I react to. This doesn\u2019t itch me at all or cause rashes. Also, it\u2019s very well made! Rib Beanie | Blush Super in love with this dress! The unique details of pleats and cut of the dress make it such a fun dress to wear. I'm also impressed by the quality of how it was made.

        "Designed for today, mindful for tomorrow. Infused with the energy of LA, NY and Mexico City, our denim tells a story of conscious design. At \u00c9TICA, we blend innovation with tradition while honoring both the planet and the diverse communities that inspire us.\u00a0 With industry-leading equipment, innovative wash techniques, and a commitment to sustainability, \u00c9TICA is setting a new standard for eco-friendly denim. We re-imagine classic denim codes by constantly pushing design and wash technology while remaining focused on achieving our zero waste initiative.\u00a0 We\u2019re all about sourcing materials that uphold the highest environmental and social responsibility standards. Our top priority is suppliers who share our passion for the planet like us.\u00a0 We use Certified Organic cotton, grown sustainably without harsh chemicals or excessive water usage, Regenerative and Recycled cotton, and plant-based eco fibers like Tencel and Refibra - all derived from sustainably farmed cellulose. Around the world, consumer goods generate around 207 million tons of waste every year, and packaging makes up over 30% of landfill waste.\u00a0\u00a0 From recycled and biodegradable threads, labels, packaging and hangtags, to non-electroplated hardware, we consider every aspect of our impact. As a vertical manufacturer, we have full transparency and control over the quality and sustainability of our product, and we are constantly innovating to lower our environmental impact.\u00a0 We produce our denim in small batches, allowing demand to drive our decisions and thus minimizing excess production. Our factory is constantly investing in the latest innovations in clean manufacturing and eco-tech equipment, and even developing some of our own. We use no harmful chemicals, pesticides, GMOs or fertilizers in our process. No stones, no chemicals. This is as clean as denim can get. Drawing on 25 years of denim manufacturing expertise, we've pioneered a groundbreaking water-saving patent pending technology known as InCloud\u00ae.\u00a0 InCloud\u00ae leverages nanotechnology at the molecular level to treat fabrics and fibers. This innovative process eliminates the need for toxic chemicals by combining EFlow nanobubbles, non-harmful ozone gases, and laser technology to achieve genuine wash effects.\u00a0 InCloud\u00ae reduces water consumption per jean from 300-600 liters to a mere 1-2 liters. Our approach employs 90% less water and consumes 70% less energy than prevailing industry benchmarks.\u00a0 In 2024 alone, InCloud\u00ae contributed to saving 2,374,536 gallons of water. We are regularly audited to ensure our standing. Here are just a few of ours: Gold Certification from the Worldwide Responsible Apparel Coalition (W.R.A.P.) SMETA certification from SEDEX, a leader in ethical production and supply chain transparency Clean Industry Practices certificate from PROFEPA and the Mexican government\u2019s national environmental audit program, PNAA Social Responsibility certificate from the Mexican Center for Philanthropy and the Alliance for Corporate Social Responsibility Our Vendor Code of Conduct contains strict guidelines for suppliers based on the tenants of the Fair Labor Association. All suppliers maintain current certifications from WRAP, GOTS, OEKO-TEX Standard 100, Cradle to Cradle or Bluesign. Our own vertical factory has been a part of the community in Puebla, Mexico for over 25 years.\u00a0 As a WRAP-certified facility, we go beyond Fair Labor standards, ensuring ethical practices. We provide workers with fair living wages and on-the-job training, which gives our employees a unique path to advancement. Our onsite water purification system cleans and recycled our factory water, which we then use to feed local farmland. Plus, we\u2019re turning used-eco stones into load-bearing bricks to help build schools and low-income housing in the area.\u00a0 We are also proud partners of 1% for the Planet and One Tree Planted.

        "\ud83c\udf0e Earth Month Specials: 60% OFF weekly selects! Shop the Earth Month Discounts tab Organic Cotton Low Impact Dyes Fair Labor One Tree Planted An updated version of everyone's favorite Hilma Wide Leg pant. This cropped two high pocket wide leg pant, with rolled edge pockets, drawstring waist, is so versatile depending on the top it is paired with. You\u00a0won't want to take them off. Jersey, 95% Organic Cotton, 5% Elastane Thank you for submitting a review! Your input is very much appreciated. Share it with your friends so they can enjoy it too! I LOVE these pants. So much. Would love some color options for my next pair! Black? Green?\r\nThey're super comfortable, versatile, and very well-made.\r\n I adore these pants. I wear a size 12ish and bought a large; I might have been able to size down, but I do like things big. There are so comfortable and the pockets actually hold my phone+. I'd like to see these in another color: blue? grey? I can't buy black because I have a fuzzy multi-pet household! Love the off-white. Wonderful fabric, too. Overall, I am in love with these pants - the shape, the fit, the flow of them. The design is fantastic. I am disappointed because they arrived with a few seams unhinged and hole-y along the pockets and gusset. So, five stars for the design, probably two or three for the seam issues.\r\n\r\nI purchased a different pair of pants in the order and those didn't have any problems. We deeply apologize that your Hilma pants came damaged. We greatly value our customer's opinions and feedback. Our customer experience team has gone ahead and processes the exchange to get you a replacement! I have two light pairs and two dark pairs and I can honestly say that they fit all body types! I am cuban and very curvy! The fabric is super soft and I have washed them 1 million times and it really holds up and it\u2019s soft and smooth still. It\u2019s a really high quality fabric with a lot of stretch and so much comfort! The cut is super cute on anyone! I tend to wear them with crop tops and jackets and I wear them out all the time and people compliment mealwats!! Seriously they are the perfect lounge pant!! I hope one day they make these ( same fabric) in a slim cut jogger and I will buy four pairs of those! If you\u2019re on the fence definitely get a pair you will not regret it!

Share it with your friends so they can enjoy it too! Like previous reviews have said, this set is so comfy and stylish! They are super well made and I love that you can mix and match with so many other things. I got the color Moonbeam in the joggers and the jacket and they're perfect! So happy with these! These are so comfy and stylish. I\u2019m 5\u20194\u201d and they are a tad long on me. If I pull the waist up under my bust and fold the cuff over they work, so I kept them. I like high waisted pants anyway, so not much of an issue for me. I love that I can wear these to work from home and out and about! Consistent with other reviews - perfect fit, love the pockets, runs true to size, super comfy, soft and well-made. Living in these black joggers. Love how they look rolled up as well. I'm 5'5'' and wearing XS. Love the Jacqueline slim jogger in black! Cozy, flattering, and runs true to size plus pockets!!!\r\n So comfortable and the perfect fit!

Your input is very much appreciated. Share it with your friends so they can enjoy it too! Today is Saturday August 13,2022 and my second opportunity to wear my jumpsuit;as it has been very humid, I had one cool night I could try it out for a couple of hours and it was very good. The weather is good for a full day test and the jumpsuit is so comfortable and stylish and great looking; a kind person was able to take some digital photos and the jumpsuit looks even better than in the mirror; Thank you so much to the Fashion Designer and the seamstresses and the founder and all the staff of YesAnd; and thank you for inspiring the words \u201cI love my jumpsuit \u201c. I love this!! It\u2019s comfortable and can be worn for fun, a casual meeting or lunch with really hip friends, lol. The snap closures are perfect for a quick letdown (listen up, older ladies - sometimes time really is of the essence) and boots or sneakers are equally awesome to go with. Oh - and it\u2019s a perfect airplane outfit. Nothing rides up or falls down, especially if you\u2019re sleeping. Anyway - buy one. You\u2019ll wear it fifty times.

They are slightly looser around the waist than expected, and the snap closure is kind of weak, so that it randomly pops open sometimes. But a belt fixes both of these issues. Overall I do love them. I love these pants! I love the fabric. It's so light and easy to wear in the summer. The loose cut is comfortable and I am a fan of the large pockets. These pants are soooo comfy and just what you want for summer chillin. Nice loose cut so they don't stick to you in the heat ( I live in humid Florida). And they are just a great fit, comfort, value and style. I love them. They will be my go to pants this summer for sure! Buy them. You will NOT regret. They run a little large. I am between a 6-8 and I was a small. I absolutely LOVE these pants. The quality, style, fit and fabric are all AMAZING. The only thing I will say is that I ordered a medium and I normally wear a 6-8 and they were very baggy on me. I am going to swap them out for a small. Size down on this one. They are meant to be baggy and loose, but mine were just a bit too large even for that. However, I would highly recommend these pants. They are awesome! Light and easy to wear, dressed up or down. Very comfy and you could live in them they feel like PJ's but very chic and classy!! Can't say enough. Will be ordering more items. Great for summer dress up.

We may earn a commission on purchases, at no additional cost to you. Learn more \u2192 \u00a0 When shopping for personal care cosmetics or makeup products, understanding Clean Beauty Certification is key to ensuring the products we use are genuinely safe and sustainable. The competitive market like the cosmetics industry, is flooded with items on the shelves with gorgeous organic, natural, herbal, or plant-based graphics and logos, making us feel like they should have the \"good stuff\" as ingredients. Only to discover that not-so-good ingredients hide in the small print on the back. \u00a0A report by the Soil Association shows that the cosmetics industry frequently uses misleading labels and highlights that many consumers feel misled by labels on \"organic\" beauty products, with 76% of consumers expressing such sentiments. How can we truly know what will be best for our bodies? By familiarizing ourselves with reliable clean beauty certifications, we can confidently select products that align with our health and environmental values. As a mother and someone who cares deeply about not only my family\u2019s health but also the environment's health, I have taken a serious inclination toward good quality skin care products that I know I can trust. By gaining a good understanding of clean beauty certifications, it has become so much easier to make the right choices. In this article, we will walk through what clean beauty truly is, debunk some common misconceptions, and explain the significance of various certifications and labels, and why they matter.  As mentioned in our recent post, Ultimate Clean Beauty Guide transcends the mere absence of harmful chemicals in cosmetics. It embodies a comprehensive approach, considering the entire lifecycle of a product\u2014from sustainable sourcing of raw materials to ethical manufacturing processes and environmentally friendly packaging. Global Market Trends The clean beauty market is witnessing substantial growth, reflecting an increasing consumer demand for safer, more sustainable products. According to Statista, as of 2021, the global market value for clean beauty was valued at around 6.5 billion U.S. dollars. The clean beauty market value is forecast to grow and reach approximately 15.3 billion U.S. dollars by 2028. The Role of Certifications in Clean Beauty Certifications play a pivotal role in guiding your choices in the clean beauty landscape. Recognizable certifications such as EWG, Made Safe, COSMOS, and Leaping Bunny provide a trusted mark of safety and eco-friendliness, so you can know and trust that the products you choose are the best for your health and the environment. Next time you go to the store, consider taking a small mental note of how many items have some form of image or label stating \"natural\" or \"organic,\" just as an example. Now, as much as this attracts us and makes us feel better about making good choices, the reality is that not everything is natural, organic, or safe and non-toxic. The truth is that these terms alone are unregulated. Simply having natural or organic ingredients in a product does not ensure that it is free from other non-natural or non-organic substances. According to a study on the 100 best-selling 'natural' cosmetic products, only 42% were found to be truly natural, while 58% contained synthetic ingredients.  Clean beauty certifications are your trusty guides in the world of skincare products. They're like a seal of approval that tells you, \"This product is safe for you and kind to our planet.\" But what exactly do they mean? In simple terms, clean beauty certifications ensure that products are free from potentially harmful ingredients like parabens, phthalates, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances. These certifications aren't handed out lightly. They involve rigorous testing and strict standards that manufacturers must meet. Here's what you need to know about the clean beauty certification process: Thorough Research: Certification bodies conduct in-depth studies to understand the impact of ingredients on human health and the environment. Strict Standards: They set clear, stringent rules that products must follow to be certified. Compliance Checks: Manufacturers undergo regular inspections to ensure they maintain good practices. Easy Identification: Certified products can display the certification mark, making it easy for you to spot them while shopping. It helps to verify that the product is exactly what it claims to be and that you can trust it wholeheartedly to be safe for you and the earth. In a world where we're bombarded with health information, these certifications cut through the noise. They: Build Trust: With strict regulations against misleading claims, certifications help you feel confident in your purchases. Promote Transparency: Certified products must disclose their ingredients and manufacturing processes, giving you the full picture. Ensure Accountability: Regular assessments keep manufacturers on their toes, ensuring they consistently meet high standards. Simplify Shopping: Instead of decoding complex ingredient lists, you can look for certification marks to make quick, informed decisions. Remember, these certifications aren't just about what's good for you \u2013 they're also about what's good for our planet. By choosing certified clean beauty products, you're supporting practices that are kinder to the environment.  Understanding the various types of clean beauty certifications can greatly simplify your shopping experience. These certifications are generally categorized based on what they assure regarding product formulation and ethical standards. Understanding these categories helps you choose products that align with your values and skincare needs, making it easier for you to pick products. A single product might carry multiple certifications, addressing various aspects of clean beauty. Organic certifications ensure that products are made with a significant proportion of organic ingredients, which are grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. Vegan certifications guarantee that products contain no animal-derived ingredients and involve no animal testing at any stage of product development. Cruelty-Free certifications ensure that neither the final product nor the ingredients have been tested on animals, emphasizing ethical treatment throughout production. Non-toxic certifications focus on safety, certifying products that are free from harmful chemicals and substances known to pose health risks. Sustainable certifications assess the environmental impact of products, including sourcing, manufacturing, and packaging, to ensure minimal ecological footprint. Fair Trade ensures that ingredients are sourced under fair labor conditions and farmers and workers along the supply chain receive fair compensation and treatment. Biodynamic certifications are similar to organic but based on more stringent practices that treat farms as interconnected living systems.  Navigating the world of clean beauty products can be complex, but understanding key certifications can make it simpler and more trustworthy. Here\u2019s a concise guide to the most significant clean beauty certifications to help you make informed choices in your personal care routine. The Environmental Working Group tracks chemical safety and certifies non-toxic products. With stringent guidelines, EWG not only ensures product safety for consumers but also holds companies accountable for using harmful chemicals. What it means: Products meet strict safety standards Why it matters: EWG calls out harmful chemicals and the companies using them Pro tip: The EWG Skin Deep Database makes it easy for you to browse certified products.

What it means: Products are safe for humans and ecosystems Why it matters: Over 6,000 potentially harmful ingredients are banned Pro tip: Browse the Made Safe Catalogue for certified products  Products certified under USDA Organic standards contain various levels of organic ingredients. These range from \"100% Organic\" to \"Made with Organic Ingredients\" (at least 70% organic ingredients). What it means: 100% organic: All ingredients are organic Organic: At least 95% organic ingredients Made with organic ingredients: At least 70% organic ingredients Specific organic ingredients: Less than 70% organic ingredients Why it matters: Ensures high-quality, organic ingredients in your products  Managed by Ecocert, COSMOS certification guarantees eco-friendly production, the responsible use of natural resources, and the exclusion of harmful petrochemical ingredients. It emphasizes biodiversity respect, recyclable packaging, and the absence of GMOs. What it means: Environmentally friendly production, no GMOs, recyclable packaging Why it matters: Guarantees absence of harmful ingredients like parabens and synthetic fragrances  In the cosmetics industry, the\u00a0NSF/ANSI 455-3\u00a0certification is a key standard that focuses on good manufacturing practices of cosmetic products, ensuring they are produced in a safe and controlled environment.\u00a0The certification mark gives consumers surety that their personal care products contain a minimum organic content of 70% and that all other ingredients meet strict criteria, such as being GMO-free.  The Non-GMO Project offers a verification program ensuring products are free from genetically modified organisms, aligning with consumers' growing preferences for natural ingredient transparency and ecological safety.

It is one of the most recognized vegan certifications worldwide, that signifies a product's adherence to vegan principles. The Vegan Trademark spans a diverse range of categories, including cosmetics, clothing, food, and household products. What it means: No animal-derived ingredients or animal testing Why it matters: Ensures products align with vegan principles and ethical practices  Even without certification marks, many products can still be clean and safe. There are some small companies and brands out there whose products are clean, safe, and non-toxic, they are honest and transparent about what they put in their products. Here's how to become a savvy clean beauty detective! Ingredient Transparency Look for a complete ingredient list on the product or packaging. No list or full ingredients disclosure? That's a red flag! Ingredient Education Familiarize yourself with common ingredients and their purposes. A quick Google search can help you with this. Use resources like the Skin Care Ingredient Dictionary for quick, reliable information. Tech-Savvy Shopping Leverage apps to make informed decisions on-the-go: Think Dirty: Scan barcodes for instant ingredient safety checks. INCI Beauty: Quickly analyze product ingredients. EWG's Healthy Living: Offers ingredient hazard scores CosmEthics: Checks for allergens and unwanted ingredients Yuka: Evaluates both food and cosmetics Decoding Marketing Terms Terms like \"natural,\" \"organic,\" and \"non-toxic\" can be misleading. Here's what they really mean: Natural: Ingredients occur in nature, not synthesized in a lab. Organic: Ingredients farmed without chemicals, pesticides, or GMOs. Non-toxic: Free from harmful or poisonous ingredients. Remember: These terms don't guarantee a product is 100% clean or safe.. Spotting Greenwashing Be alert to misleading marketing tactics: Vague eco-friendly claims Nature-themed imagery Overemphasis on a single \"green\" aspect Exaggerated benefits Your Clean Beauty Action Plan Always check the full ingredient list. Research unfamiliar ingredients. Use apps for quick on-the-spot checks. Look beyond marketing terms for actual ingredient quality. Be skeptical of overly \"green\" marketing without substance.

I certainly didn't - until persistent hormonal issues led me down a rabbit hole of research about endocrine disruptors. These sneaky chemicals lurk in everything, they're in our food and water, our everyday consumer products, even in the air we breathe, silently interfering with our body's natural hormone functions. The reality is disturbing: research shows that endocrine disruptors can contribute to fertility problems, mood swings, weight issues, and even certain cancers. When I first started learning about endocrine disrupting chemicals, I was overwhelmed, realising there was so many chemicals hiding in so many of the products I used everyday especially my beauty products. But here's the empowering part: we can take control. Through my own healing journey, I've discovered six simple yet powerful ways to reduce exposure to these chemicals. These aren't about making drastic overnight changes, by making gradual mindful changes to non-toxic products, you can significantly reduce your exposure. Let me show you how to create a safer, healthier environment for yourself and your family. Here are six practical and manageable ways to reduce your exposure to endocrine disruptors today.  Think of your endocrine system as your body's incredibly sophisticated messaging network. Scattered throughout your body are special glands, each producing unique hormones that act like chemical messengers in your bloodstream. These hormones orchestrate everything from your morning energy levels to your reproductive health, from your metabolism to your mood. But here's where things get concerning: endocrine disruptors are like uninvited guests that crash this delicate messaging system. Endocrine disruptors are natural or man-made chemicals found in many of our everyday products that can block, mimic or interfere with hormones produced by the endocrine system, that can cause a wealth of health problems. Alarmingly, out of the 85,000 man-made chemicals identified, it was reported that more than 1,000 could be endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors also drive chronic inflammation, a key factor in thyroid disorders like Hashimoto\u2019s.\u00a0Dr. Mark Hyman,\u00a0a leading figure in the field of functional medicine explains: \u201cIncreased exposure to environmental toxins, chronic stress, and a poor diet are driving the epidemic of thyroid issues.\u201d Endocrine disruptors like BPA, phthalates, and dioxins mimic or block hormones, wreaking havoc on this essential gland.  In Europe, there is currently a list of over 80 chemicals that have been identified as endocrine disrupting chemicals, however, as mentioned before, this number is susceptibly greater than this. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the most common hormone-disrupting chemicals that you may encounter without realizing it: Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances - The forever chemicals Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are notoriously known 'forever chemicals' because they don't break down easily, either in the environment or our bodies. PFAS are well known endocrine disruptor, and are found everywhere - from non-stick cookware and water-resistant gear to personal items, stain-resistant fabrics, and even sources of drinking water. A study published by Grandjean et al. (2012) connected PFAS exposure with decreased immune function.  Phthalates - The flexibility boosters Certain phthalates are added to products to give material's their flexibility, found in personal care products like shampoos, food packaging, vinyl flooring and plastic shower curtains, and even in children's toys, they pose significant health issues, often overlooked in our daily lives. Studies have linked phthalates with reduced sperm count and developmental issues (Swan et al., 2005). Parabens - The 'sneaky' preservatives Parabens are preservatives that extend the shelf life of cosmetic products like skincare and makeup but they are also hormone disruptors. They can be identified in products by the names of methyl-, ethyl- or butyl-paraben etc. Bispehnol A (BPA) - The plastic offender Found in various plastics and epoxy resins, BPAs strengthen water bottles and containers. Items marked with recycling code #7 are particularly likely to contain BPA, making it important to stay vigilant about what we store in our food in. Research has shown BPA's ability to mimic estrogen can lead to reproductive disorders including infertility (Vandenberg et al., 2012). Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) - Banned but Persistent  Once widely used in electrical equipment and paints, PCBS are now banned for their toxic effects. Despite this ban, they are still lingering in our environment, and tend to accumulate in animal products particularly fish, meat and dairy Dioxins - Combustion byproducts  Dioxins are highly toxic byproducts of industrial and manufacturing processes. They often accumulate in animal products, and contaminate soil and water around industrial sites, posing a risk to our health through the food chain Atrazine - Weed Killer  A prevalent herbicide used in agriculture, atrazine is often used on crops and leach into nearby soil and water supplies. Overtime this contamination spreads, making its way into our food and water Flame Retardants - Fire safety with a hidden risk Brominated flame retardants are added to reduce flammability in consumer products - from furniture and electronics to insulation and children's products like car seats, and foam play matts. flame retardant chemicals come with hidden health risks, they can accumulate in dust and can be easily absorbed into the body when exposed Triclosan- The 'antibacterial' additive Triclosan, found in anti-bacterial products, was once a staple in anti-bacterial soaps, but now is being phased out due to growing health concerns, especially as an endocrine disruptor. However, it still lurks in 'anti-microbial' kitchenware, hand sanitisers, and even toothpaste Perchlorate - The water contaminant  Perchlorate, an ingredient in rocket fuel and fireworks, often contaminates water sources, particularly near industrial sites. These chemicals distribute into soils, affecting crops, and creeping into meat and dairy products. Arsenic \u2013 The Environmental ToxinArsenic is a naturally occurring element that can contaminate drinking water through industrial pollution or agricultural runoff. Long-term exposure to arsenic has been linked to various cancers as well as disruptions in hormone signaling related to insulin regulation. Lead \u2013 The Neurotoxic MetalLead is a heavy metal that can interfere with multiple bodily systems but is particularly harmful to the nervous system. It also acts as an endocrine disruptor by interfering with hormone signaling pathways. Lead exposure primarily comes from old paint, contaminated water pipes, and different products like imported toys, even in coventional cosmetics, and has been associated with cognitive deficits due to its neurotoxic effects (Lanphear et al., 2005).  Researchers have observed a troubling trend: both average intelligence levels and fertility rates have been declining since around the year 2000. Studies conducted in countries like the UK and Denmark show a decrease in IQ scores after decades of continuous increase\u2014a phenomenon attributed partly to environmental factors like endocrine disruptors (Flynn et al., 2013). Additionally, fertility rates have dropped significantly worldwide; more couples struggle with infertility than ever before. The World Health Organization (WHO) has pointed out that endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be contributing factors by interfering with sex hormones (WHO Report on EDCs, 2012). These same chemicals are also believed to be responsible for earlier onset puberty in children as well as rising rates of breast cancer and testicular cancer (Skakkebaek et al., 2016). Non-toxic cleaning products - I started swamping out household cleaners and was pleasantly surprised by how well natural, and more non-toxic alternative cleaners do without all of the added synthetic chemicals. When shopping look for 'green-certified' products and avoid products with synthetic fragrance. Opt for more natural soaps to and avoid 'anti-bacterial' soaps as they are likely to include triclosan Avoid non-stick cookware - ditch non-stick pans that release PFAS chemicals when heated, and instead purchase stainless steel, cast iron, or ceramic cookware, these alternatives are often more durable too Hypoallergenic laundry products - Switch to laundry detergents and fabric softeners that are green-certified and hypoallergenic, this can be an easy swap and reduce your exposure to toxic chemicals found in conventional cleaners Dusting and vacuuming - Instead of dry dusting try using a damp cloth or a microfibre cloth, which helps you gather and trap household dust more effectively. A vacuum with a HEPA (high-efficency particulate air) filter can help you trap the smallest of particles more efficiently, that may be missed with a standard vacuum Improve ventilation - Fresh air helps remove VOCs and makes a world of difference - keeping windows open or adding an air purifier and maybe even a few house plants can transform your space. Opt for no-shoes policy - This is a simple general rule that you can implement to avoid bringing in outdoor contaminants into your living space Clean Beauty - Switching my personal care products was eye opening - there are so many products that contain phthalates, parabens and release PFAS. However, I was surprised by how many great brands that offer natural alternatives. Mineral-based suncreens have also become my go-to over chemical ones, as they contain less toxic compounds, I would recommend making the swap! Avoid perfumed beauty and wellness products - avoid products with 'fragrance' or 'perfume' this can be challenge but there are plenty of natural beauty ranges nowadays! Limit use of chemical-based nail polishers and removers - choose brands that are labeled as '3-free' or '5-free', which indicates the absence of certain PFAS that are present in these products Choose sustainable natural fibres - Synthetic fabrics like polyester, acrylic and nylon are often treated with chemicals like flame retardants. Natural fibres like cotton, wool, linen are free of these chemicals and will feel nicer on your skin! Ditch treated fabrics - Avoid fabrics with 'stain-resistant' or 'wrinkle-free' treatments as these may contain PFCs and ALWAYS wash new clothing, towels and bedding before use to reduce chemical exposure Avoid plastic containers and cooking utensils - Plastic containers can leach chemicals like BPA, especially when heated, so always avoid microwaving plastic products. My favourite alternative is a glass food container - it is easy to clean (and doesn't taste like plastic). Silicone and stainless steel containers are also great options. If you must use plastics, opt for BPA-free options for food storage Avoid single-use water bottles - BPA is extremely prevalent in single-use water bottles, swapping to a reusable water bottle is a game changer, and you'll never have to buy another single use water bottle ever again - it is also more eco-friendly too! Opt for non-plastic children's toys - Children are particularly susceptible to the harmful effects of toxic chemicals, especially as they're still growing - avoid purchasing plastic toys to prevent your children being exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals Invest in a water filter - By installing a water filter you can remove pesticides, pharmaceuticals and common contaminants like BPA and PFAS, it is worth it for your health! Choose organic when possible - Purchase organic fruits and vegetables to mimizine pesticide exposure, particularly items that have high pesticide residues like strawberries, apples and spinach Avoid processed foods and reduce meat - Cutting back on processed foods and meats can reduce your exposure to common endocrine disruptors, also avoid canned foods (unless BPA free)  When shopping for safer products that limit exposure to endocrine disruptors, look for these trusted certifications: Green Seal or ECO logo - Found on cleaning products - these labels ensure products meet strict adherence to environmental health and safety standards, minimising health risks USDA Organic: This label ensures that foods meet strict guidelines regarding pesticide use\u2014important for reducing exposure from organophosphate pesticides. EcoCert - Certifying personal care and cleaning products, this label confirms at least 95% natural and sustainably sourced ingredients Fair Trade Certified: Ensures ethical sourcing practices while also limiting harmful chemicals used during production. Greenguard certification - Used for building materials an furniture, this certification can ensure low chemical emission for improved air quality and safer products EWG verified - The Environmental Working Group prioritises high health and safety standard for cosmetics and household products. Their EWG Skin Deep app is a handy tool for checking product safety, especially for cosmetics. However, there is a wealth of ingredient decoding apps that can help you read a cosmetics list.  Supporting your thyroid naturally involves not just avoiding harmful chemicals but also nourishing your body with the right nutrients and practices. Here\u2019s a quick guide based on Dr. Hyman\u2019s recommendations:  \u2022 Vitamin B2, B6, B12: Aid in energy production and hormone regulation.  \u2022 Vitamin D (2000 IU daily): Boosts immune function and reduces inflammation.  \u2022 Vitamin A: Critical for converting T4 to T3.  \u2022 Selenium: Essential for thyroid hormone synthesis and protection against oxidative stress (e.g., 1\u20132 Brazil nuts per day).  \u2022 Zinc (30 mg daily): Supports T4 to T3 conversion.  \u2022 Iron: Supports oxygen transport and thyroid function.  \u2022 Ashwagandha (1000 mg daily): Balances hormones and reduces stress.  \u2022 Rhodiola Rosea: Boosts energy and adrenal health.  \u2022 Cordyceps Mushrooms: Enhances thyroid and immune function.  \u2022 Infrared Sauna: Detoxifies the body from endocrine disruptors like heavy metals and BPA.  \u2022 Acupuncture: Balances hormones and reduces stress.  \u2022 Daily Movement: Incorporate walking, yoga, or strength training to regulate metabolism and reduce cortisol.  \u2022 Herbal Teas: Cinnamon, ginger, and turmeric teas reduce inflammation and support digestive health. While endocrine disruptors are everywhere - from our beauty products to our cookware - transitioning to a non-toxic way of living can significantly reduce our exposure through mindful choices Those most vulnerable to these chemicals are pregnant women, developing babies, young children, and teenagers - making it especially important to create a safer environment for your family Start with the easiest changes that have the biggest impact: switching to clean personal care products, choosing safer cookware, and filtering your drinking water Remember this journey to non-toxic living is a process - focus on progress over perfection and make gradual changes that feel sustainable for your lifestyle Use trusted certifications to help guide your choices when shopping for safer alternatives If you enjoyed this post, check out these articles on safe and non-toxic products: Best Natural & Non-Toxic Perfume Brands for Blissful Scents Best Non-Toxic Skincare Brands for a Vibrant Glow Clean Makeup Brands: Natural and Non-Toxic Makeup for Healthy Skin Best Non Toxic Soaps with Organic Ingredients While it is nearly impossible to completely avoid endocrine disruptors due to their widespread presence in everyday products and the environment, you can significantly reduce exposure by making informed choices. Opt for organic foods, avoid plastic containers (especially for food storage), and choose personal care products free from harmful chemicals like parabens and phthalates.  Foods that are often high in endocrine disruptors include those packaged in plastic or canned containers, as these can leach chemicals like Bisphenol A (BPA) into the food. Additionally, non-organic produce may contain pesticide residues that act as endocrine disruptors, such as atrazine. Processed meats and dairy products can also contain hormone-disrupting chemicals due to the use of growth hormones and contaminated feed. Reducing exposure to hormone disruptors involves several lifestyle changes. Choose organic fruits and vegetables to avoid pesticide residues, and store food in glass or stainless steel containers instead of plastic. Opt for personal care products labeled \"paraben-free\" and \"phthalate-free,\" and avoid processed or canned foods when possible. Additionally, using natural cleaning products can help minimize contact with harmful chemicals in household environments. Products that commonly contain high levels of endocrine disruptors include plastics with BPA or phthalates, such as water bottles and food storage containers. Personal care items like shampoos, lotions, and cosmetics often contain parabens and phthalates unless labeled otherwise. Household cleaning products with synthetic fragrances or harsh chemicals may also contribute to exposure. Choosing safer alternatives in these categories can help reduce your risk. The \"Dirty Dozen\" endocrine disruptors include some of the most harmful chemicals known for their ability to interfere with hormone systems. These include Bisphenol A (BPA), dioxins, atrazine, phthalates, perchlorate, fire retardants (PBDEs), lead, arsenic, mercury, perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), organophosphate pesticides, and glycol ethers. One of the most common endocrine disruptors is Bisphenol A (BPA), which is widely used in plastics and epoxy resins found in food containers, water bottles, and can linings. BPA is known for mimicking estrogen in the body and has been linked to various health issues, including reproductive disorders and metabolic problems Millie Chamberlain is a passionate medical writer based in London.

If you're wondering\u00a0how to avoid PFAS in cosmetics, you're not alone. I always assumed that since cosmetic companies test their products, they must be safe - but that's not always true. Many everyday cosmetics contain harmful ingredients, including PFAS, known as 'forever chemicals', which are as the name suggests, a collection of toxic chemicals that stick around for too long. As of 2024, the concern over PFAS in cosmetics has reached new heights. Recent studies and regulatory actions have put these 'forever chemicals' in the spotlight, making it more important than ever to understand how to avoid PFAS in your beauty products. If this raises some red flags for you, then you are not alone, but by understanding PFAS and how to avoid them can empower you to make safer choices for your beauty routine and well-being. Let's dive into what PFAS are, how to spot them, and how to spot them, and steps you can take today to avoid these toxic chemicals.  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large collection of 15,000 synthetic, man-made chemicals, used in a range of products since the 1950's. PFAS are found in everything from food packaging, non-stick cookware, (yes, your teflon frying pan) to clothes, popular makeup products, furniture and carpets, and even tampons and other\u00a0menstrual products! Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) include: Perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) Perfluorocarboxylic acid (PFCA), like Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and its derivatives (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) Usually in cosmetics:perfluorooctyl triethoxysilane, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), perfluorodecalin, perfluorononyl dimethicone.  PFAS are intentionally added to products to make them smooth, shiny, water-resistant and more durable etc. They are commonly used in most cosmetic products from your eyeliner and eyeshadows to your cleansers, nail polish and shaving creams. However, the products with the most significant amount of PFAS include waterproof mascara, foundations and lipstick. In 2021, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) reviewed the Skin Deep Database of ingredients listed in all of its cosmetic products, and found 13 different PFAS chemicals used in over 300 products across 50 brands. PFAS will never be listed outright on cosmetics packaging, its crucial to know what you are looking and how to spot them on cosmetic ingredient lists. The easiest ways to are to: Look for terms like 'waterproof', 'smudge-proof' or 'long-lasting' Watch for ingredients that contain 'fluoro' in their names, as these ingredients are fluoropolymers, common examples include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), perfluoroctoanesulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)  PFAS chemicals raise concerns among scientists and public health officials, they're incredibly persistant and do not degrade easily due to their strong carbon-fluorine bond, meaning they build up in the environment, and in our bodies. Dr. Rhonda Patrick, a renowned expert in biomedical science and nutrition, explains, \"PFAS are particularly troubling because they have half-lives that are several years long, meaning they persist in the body and accumulate over time.\" When these chemicals enter our system - whether through ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact - they're rapidly absorbed and processed by our liver. But unlike many other toxins, our bodies struggle to break them down efficiently. The health risks associated with PFAS exposure are still being uncovered, with ongoing research revealing a growing list of concerns. Your personal risk level depends on the amount of PFAS exposure, that is various factors, including the products you use, your living and working environment, and even the quality of your local water supply. While the full extent of PFAS-related health issues is yet to be determined, several serious conditions have already been linked to exposure. Here are just a few known common health risks associated with PFAS: Cancers (kidney, breast and testicular) Pregnancy complications including preeclampsia (associated with maternal high blood pressure), increased risk of miscarriage and low birth weight Thyroid disease, liver damage, increased cholesterol levels These health risks underscore the importance of minimizing our exposure to PFAS, particularly in everyday products like cosmetics.  Forever chemicals can take around 1,000 years to breakdown. Health and Environmental Aliliance (HEAL), reported that due to the widespread use of PFAS, it is estimated that round 12.5 million Europeans live in communities with drinking water contaminated with PFAS. PFAS cannot be removed from water supplies through standard water treatment, these PFAS are then free to roam, flowing into seas, then eventually ocean circulations. It has been recently reported that PFAS have been found in our marine animals all over the world, from penguins to even polar bears! Luckily, there are things we can do to avoid PFAS in our daily lives especially when it comes to cosmetics, because who wants to give up makeup - not me. One of the things you can do today to start your journey into non-toxic holistic lifestyle, is familiarising yourself with common PFAS-containing ingredients. This is easier said than done, but fortunately there are ingredient checker apps that do this for us to decode products entire ingredient lists! Here are a few apps you can use today: EWG's Skin Deep Think Dirty app CosDNA Yuka Another helpful thing to look for is clean beauty certifications, e.g. EWG verified products have very strict standards for health and transparency. However, there are many like certifications including USDA organic, COSMOS organic, MADE SAFE, EWG verified that can help you navigate clean beauty. Reading between the lines on product labels is important as most brands will use marketing language to make their products seem safer. Here are a few helpful terms to avoid being a victim to misleading marketing; Green washing - brands can label their product as 'eco-friendly' or 'natural', but they can still contain PFAS, as these terms are not regulated, fluorinated compounds can be hidden under terms like 'conditioning agents' or 'film-formers'. 'Dermatologist-recommended' or 'hypoallergenic' - these terms do not guarantee a products safety or that it is PFAS, companies can use these terms without testing for ingredients like PFAS 'Fragrance' or 'parfum' - these terms alone can hide thousands of toxic ingredients, the term fragrance is also not regulated If you really want to know how to steer clear of PFAS in your makeup bag, getting comfortable with those ingredient lists is key. We know it can be overwhelming, so we've put together a super helpful guide that breaks down how to read these tricky cosmetic ingredient lists:\u00a0How to Read Cosmetic Ingredients Lists\u00a0for in-depth information on navigating these often confusing labels. Be also wary of 'BPA-free' labels on cosmetics and other products. Manufacturers often replace BPA with chemicals like BPS, which may have similar harmful effects.  In many countries, especially the US, cosmetics and personal care products are under regulated, and there is a lack of transparency as to what goes into our makeup, especially around PFAS. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) recently updated their cosmetic legislation, called The Modernisation of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022, which enforces authority over cosmetic industries. This was the first major update to the cosmetic regulation since 1938! As prior to this update, the FDA had no authority over cosmetic safety testing or pre-approving ingredients before a product hits the shelves, allowing PFAS to be used with minimal oversight. Moreover, as of early 2023, several U.S. states have begun implementing their own PFAS bans in various products, including cosmetics. Maine, for instance, has passed a law requiring companies to report products containing intentionally added PFAS, with a complete ban set to take effect in 2030. In April 2024, the EPA designated two widely used PFAS\u2014PFOA and PFOS\u2014as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund. This designation aims to improve transparency and accountability in cleaning up PFAS contamination  In Europe, there has been significant progress in this field, in comparison. In February 2023, the EU Chemical Agency (ECHA) published a draft proposal for a restriction on the production of PFAS, in Europe. Today, HEAL and with more than 100 other civil societies are calling to #BanPFAS, which includes to ban PFAS contains products by 2025, and to have this completed by 2030 to help remove PFAS from the environment for our safety. Countries like Canada are also taking steps to regulate PFAS through comprehensive risk management plans that assess environmental and human health impacts In an effort to move towards cleaner beauty, Sephora now have a curated collection of products called the 'Clean at Sephora', which are formulated with safer formulations, free from a wide range of toxic ingredients including PFAS! These developments reflect a global trend towards stricter regulation of PFAS to protect human health and the environment. The regulatory landscape is expected to continue evolving as more scientific evaluations are completed and new regulations are implemented. While the primary focus should be on avoiding PFAS in cosmetics and other products, it's also important to support our body's natural detoxification processes. There are strategies that may help our bodies eliminate toxins more efficiently, like: Boost sulforaphane intake: Incorporate broccoli sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables into your diet. Sulforaphane has been shown to activate detoxification enzymes in the body, potentially helping to process and eliminate harmful chemicals like those found in some cosmetics. Increase dietary fiber: A high-fiber diet can bind to toxins in the digestive tract, potentially reducing their absorption and promoting their excretion. This could be particularly beneficial when it comes to ingested toxins from lip products or hand-to-mouth transfer of cosmetics. Sweat it out: Engaging in activities that promote sweating, such as exercise, sauna use, or hot yoga, may help eliminate trace amounts of harmful chemicals through sweat. While most PFAS are eliminated through urine, some studies have shown that sweating can also contribute to the excretion of certain toxins. While these strategies may support overall health and detoxification, they are not a substitute for avoiding PFAS and other harmful chemicals in the first place. The most effective approach is to combine mindful product choices with a healthy lifestyle that supports your body's natural detoxification processes. PFAS are synthetic chemicals, used in a range of our cosmetic products, used to make them durable and water resistant. These ingredients are not always disclosed but can be identified by use of the words 'flouro' or 'long-lasting' PFAS or 'forever chemicals' do not break down easily, resulting in accumulation the environment and the human body. Exposure to PFAS has been linked to various health issues including, cancers, pregnancy complications and organ damage You can avoid PFAS by simply swapping to PFAS-free products, and scanning your existing beauty products for fluorinated compounds. Using apps like EWG's Skin Deep or Think Dirty can assist you in identifying safer cosmetics. Many brands are PFAS-free, offering many PFAS-free makeup and skincare options, brands like ILIA beauty, 100% Pure and RMS Beauty, and more, offer good alternatives. Clean beautify certifications like 'EWG verified' are always helpful in identifying clean brands too. There are things being done within the industry to address PFAS in cosmetics, so do not fret! Updates to existing legislation in the EU and the US, are becoming stricter, however, minimising your own risk to PFAS is also important!  There are many non-toxic makeup brands that use PFAS-free formulas, with many brands offering PFAS-free ranges, the switch to a non-toxic products has never been easier. Here are a few of the best and trustworthy brands on the market which offer PFAS-free makeup and skincare: PFAS-free foundation, PFAS-free mascara, PFAS-free eyeshadow, PFAS-free lipstick: 100% Pure* Ilia * bareMinerals* Juice Beauty* Ere Perez* RMS * PFAS-free skincare 100% Pure* OSEA Malibu* Primally Pure * Activist Skincare* For more in-depth information on reducing your exposure to PFAS and other harmful chemicals, check out Dr. Rhonda Patrick's comprehensive video on the topic! This resource offers additional strategies and insights that complement our guide on avoiding PFAS in cosmetics:  To determine if your makeup contains PFAS, check the ingredient list for terms like \"perfluoro\" or \"polyfluoro,\" which indicate the presence of these substances. Additionally, using apps or databases such as EWG Database or CosmEthics can help identify PFAS-containing products by cross-referencing ingredient lists against known PFAS compounds Protecting yourself from PFAS involves choosing products from brands committed to non-toxic formulations and transparency. Find makeup and skincare products that explicitly state they are free from PFAS and other harmful chemicals. Supporting brands with certifications like EWG Verified can also ensure safer choices. Preventing PFAS in cosmetics requires stricter regulations and better industry practices to eliminate these substances from product formulations.

I thought I was doing everything right by choosing products that smelled good and made me feel confident. But the deeper I reaserached into the ingredients in perfumes and scented personal care products, the more I realized that many fragrances contain harmful chemicals that are anything but harmless. If you\u2019re curious (or maybe even a bit concerned, like I was), you\u2019re in the right place. In this article, we\u2019ll explore why fragrance is bad for you, the effects of inhaling perfumes, and what healthier, non-toxic swaps are available for you to embrace a cleaner and safer way of smelling good. Fragrance is an umbrella term used to describe a hidden mix of thousands of untested, potentially harmful chemicals. The fragrance industry use \u2018fragrance\u2019 as a loophole to avoid listing individual ingredients, keeping their trade secrets. According to the International Fragrance Association (IFRA), over 3,500 fragrance chemical compounds are used in everyday personal care products, from your favourite shampoo to household air fresheners, without full transparency.  Have you ever wondered what \u2018fragrance\u2019 really means? Fragrance chemicals can either be natural or synthetic, with most fragrances used today containing hidden chemicals that are synthetic. Fragrance ingredients can mask unpleasant odors, however, their attractive scents can be deceiving. In 2004, the average adult used about 12 personal care products a day that contained fragrances, from shampoos to cleansers, with even more fragranced consumer products on the store shelves today, that number has only risen.\u00a0 Natural fragrance typical contains two components: aromatic compounds and musk, derived from various plant parts. Synthetic fragrances, on the hand are a whole different story, packed with a cocktail of synthetic chemicals, here\u2019s to name a few of the most common which are detrimental to human health due to their toxic effects. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) \u00a0like acetaldehydes, ethanol, acetone, limonene, beta-pinene, and alpha-pinene Parabens (e.g., methyl, prophyl butyl and ethyl paraben) that act as preservatives in perfumes, shampoos, deodorants, and cosmetics but are used as fungicides and bactericides. Phthalates, the most common being diethyl phthalate (DEP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) that are chemicals used to make perfumes last longer Synthetic musk's, which mimic natural hormones, disrupting normal endocrine and biological processes.  Cosmetic products like perfume and cologne or ''eau de parfum\" or \"eau de cologne', though popular, can pose some adverse health effects. Shockingly, a survey found that 70.9% of perfume users had no idea that their perfumes could harm them, and had no idea that most perfumes were considered toxic substances. But what does really hide inside of perfume bottle? I don't\u00b4think you will like the answer Fragrance chemicals can enter the body through, inhalation, skin absorption, and even ingestion, making their way into the bloodstream. Once inside the toxic chemicals can cause a multitude of toxic adverse effects, disrupting various systems and organs. Here are some of the adverse health effects associated with fragrance...  Even your most fine fragrances can affect the central nervous system and brain, some of which are immediate, whilst others are longer-term. Inhalation exposure to potentially harmful ingredients are detected by receptors in the mouth, nose, and eyes. Since the olfactory receptors are directly connected to the brain, there is no surprise that these toxic chemicals can affect your brain. Interestingly, while we can detect perfume at low levels, after some time, our sense of smell dulls, which often leads to us over-applying fragrance to the desired amount. \u00a0 In the short term, headaches, dizziness and migraines are a common side effect of fragrance use. However, more alarmingly\u2026 Animal studies have linked fragrance products called p-cymene, a fragrance chemical to weakness, headaches and reduced neurological pathways in the brain Synthetic musks like galaxolide, and tonalide, have been associated with brain cell degeneration, potentially increasing the risk of diseases like Parkinson\u2019s disease As fragrance enters the airway through inhalation exposure, individuals with asthma face heightened risks, as exposure to some fragrances can induce severe reactions \u2013 even at low concentrations. For many, just a whiff of a scented air freshener can spark an asthma attack. Not only asthma sufferers should be concerned, as once these toxic ingredients are in the respiratory tract they can cause a cascade of toxic effects, inducing airway irritation, inflammation, coughing and even difficulty breathing. \u00a0Are fragrance mixtures silently harming your reproductive health? Alarmingly, there is increasing evidence that suggests the toxic chemicals in fragrances are endocrine disrupters, effecting the reproductive system, and even fertility. In one study, 17 fragrances were found to contain an average of four endocrine disrupting chemicals \u2013 most notably being synthetic musks and DEP. Synthetic fragrance musks can mimic natural hormones, messing with the body\u2019s natural balance and disrupting the endocrine system , which may a critical role in fertility and reproductive health. Phalatates like DEP have been associated with abnormal male reproductive development in infant boys, and sperm damage in adult men. However, even more alarmingly, high levels of musk ketone and musk xylene have been linked to gynecological issues like infertility and ovarian failure in women. It is not so much of a mystery that fragrance harbors hidden carcinogens. Yes this meants that perfume can cause cancer, and no the perfume industry do not want you to know this.. For instance, parabens, multiple studies have strongly linked these chemicals to breast cancer. Unfortunately, parabens are not the only offenders, formaldehyde, benzene and styrene, found in many scented products have been found to be linked with cancer risk. \u00a0 In 2010, a study conducted by Environmental Working Group (EWG) found 14 out of 17 popular perfumes at that time contained carcinogens. Did you know that\u2026 Fragrance allergies impact up to 11% of the global population, affecting millions of people. Fragrance can sensitize on the skin, meaning repeated exposure can cause someone to develop a fragrance allergy. Cross-sensitization can also occur, where a person becomes has an allergic reactions to different substance after initial exposure. Once sensitized, avoiding the allergen is crucial, as further exposure can lead to worsened reactions to the fragrance, causing an immune response, and severe allergies like a contact allergy called contact dermatitis \u2013 a skin condition causing swelling, itching and redness. Fragrances are a leading cause of cosmetic contact dermatitis, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Studies on children aged 5-15 show that the common allergic reactions are to parabens (43%), potassium dichromate, an agent used in tanning and painting (27%), and perfume (26%). Despite the risks, only 26 out of the 82 known fragrance allergens identified by the European Union\u2019s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety are required to be listed on product labels, including toxic chemicals like eugenol, citral and cinnamal.  Fragrance is everywhere these days, including the world around us, with fragrance containing products emitting over 10 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air, affecting public health. Volatile organic compounds are a significant source of air quality issues. In fact, a recent study, revealed that personal care and household products contribute significantly to the VOCs emission that harm the atmosphere. What\u2019s more, these toxic chemical compounds do not vanish, they are absorbed by the ocean, soil, and greenery which surrounds us. Fragrance consumer products, are often a primary source of indoor air pollutants, and are implacited as major contributors to outdoor air pollution. According to a new study, volatile organic compounds present in personal care and household products leads to substantial emissions of volatile organic compounds to the atmosphere, contributing half of the VOCs that cause air pollution. These volatile toxic chemicals have been shown to be taken up from the air by plants. Another issue with fragrances being used in most laundry detergents and cleaners, is that these wash down our drains, accumulating in our reviews and sewers. Unfortunately, current water treatment techniques cannot effectively remove these compounds well, causing build-up in aquatic ecosystems. When in water these chemicals are referred to as \u2018persistent organic pollutants\u2019, these toxic chemicals can be deadly to wildlife, and in turn disrupt the food chain. \u00a0Fragrance manufacturers and the cosmetic companies are not legally required to disclose their ingredients, often claiming their formulas are confidential, maintaining their trade secrets. Terms like \u2018fragrance\u2019 is \u2018perfume\u2019 or \u2018parfum\u2019 often mask a mixture of undisclosed chemicals, leaving consumers and professionals in the dark about the potential health implications and their influence as air pollutants. Interestingly, these regulations differ by countries. Countries including the US, Europe and Canada, use the IFRA and the Research Institute for Fragrance Materials (RIFM) to get advice on the safety standards when it comes to fragrance regulations. Up until now, the European Union currently has banned over 2,500 fragrance ingredients, whilst in the US, the FDA only has banned 11. This discrepancy is largely due to the FDA not reviewing fragrances before they hit the market. The first step in reducing exposure to harmful fragrance chemicals is learning to read labls, and spot safe cosmetic products. Thankfully, there are several ingredient checker apps \u00a0that can help you do just that, just by scanning the barcode, you can decode how potentially harmful the product. \u00a0This is the first step in identifying clean beauty\u00a0products. You can refer to our clean beauty guide to better understand which products are truly safe. Avoid products that list \u00a0\u201cfragrance\u201d in the ingredients Look for products with the EWG VERIFIED stamp, they prioritise consumer safety and ensure personal care products they strict health standards Enhance your home\u2019s air quality with houseplants, natural ventilation, or air purifiers Can you trust natural fragrances or organic products? Not necessarily. Even personal care products labeled organic\u2019 or \u2018natural\u2019, can still contain synthetic substances.  When seeking \u201cFragrance-free\u201d options, remember that \u201cunscented\u201d fragranced products often still contain fragrance materials to mask unpleasant smells. True fragrance-free products, although limited, often the same functionality without the health risks. Have faith there are options, once you familiarized with trusted brands, living a \u2018fragrance-free\u2019 and by default, a more sustainable lifestyle\u00a0will feel more natural. Essential oils can still mask an unpleasant odor, providing a natural scent, and some contain antibacterial properties, a little goes a long way. However, be cautious with their use, always use oils with water or carrier substances to reduce their concentration and discontinue use if you experience headaches or skin irritation. Bone points if you choose essential oils which have been sustainably harvested. Don\u2019t worry, Advocacy groups including the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics and the Environmental working group are working tirelessly to push for safer formulations, stricter regulations from cosmetic companies and complete ingredient disclosure. \u2022 Fragrances are composed of thousands of hidden, often toxic chemicals that are not fully disclosed on product labels. \u2022 Common harmful ingredients in perfumes include phthalates, parabens, BHT, synthetic musks, and styrene, which can cause health issues such as hormone disruption, respiratory problems, and cancer. \u2022 Perfumes and scented personal care products can cause long-term health effects, including endocrine disruption and an increased risk of cancer. \u2022 Non-toxic perfumes are made with natural ingredients, avoiding harmful chemicals, making them a safer alternative for your health and the environment. \u2022 Opting for fragrance-free or natural non-toxic products reduces your exposure to harmful chemicals, benefiting your overall health and minimizing environmental impact. Fragrances in everyday personal care and household products can negatively impact your health. By making simple swaps for fragrance-free personal care products or using natural fragrance, you can avoid hidden toxins, and be more environmentally conscious\u2014a win-win!  When you inhale perfume, you are exposed to fragrance chemicals, including VOCs, which can enter the body through inhalation, skin absorption, or ingestion. These compounds are absorbed by olfactory receptors that are directly connected to the brain, leading to immediate and potentially adverse effects. Common symptoms from inhaling perfume include headaches, dizziness, and respiratory issues, particularly for individuals with asthma or allergies.Moreover, perfumes often contain endocrine disruptors and other toxic ingredients that can linger in the bloodstream. These substances may impact the nervous system and other bodily functions over time. The presence of VOCs in perfumes is well-documented, and they can trigger various health issues such as respiratory problems (e.g., difficulty breathing, coughing), allergic reactions, and migraine headaches. Yes, perfume can potentially damage your lungs, especially if you have underlying respiratory conditions like asthma. Perfumes often contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can irritate the airways and exacerbate symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and asthma attacks. While VOCs from natural sources like forests can have beneficial effects, synthetic VOCs in perfumes may pose health risks Fragrances in products often contain a mix of chemicals that are not always disclosed or regulated. These chemicals can cause skin irritation and disrupt hormones. Some studies suggest that certain fragrance compounds may be linked to more severe health issues, including cancer, although this is still a subject of ongoing research. Opting for fragrance-free or non-toxic alternatives can be a safer choice Fragrances in skincare products can lead to skin irritation and allergic reactions. They may also exacerbate existing skin conditions such as eczema. Additionally, some fragrance ingredients are known to disrupt hormones, making them unsuitable for regular use on the skin Wearing fragrance can be harmful due to the presence of potentially toxic chemicals in many perfumes. These substances can be absorbed through the skin or inhaled, leading to health issues such as headaches, dizziness, hormone disruption, and an increased risk of cancer. It is advisable to choose perfumes that clearly label their ingredients and avoid harmful chemicals Yes, it is generally advisable to avoid products containing BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene), as it is a synthetic antioxidant linked to hormone disruption and other health risks. Natural preservatives are often recommended as safer alternatives Styrene is found in some perfumes and is classified as a possible human carcinogen. Its presence can increase cancer risk, so it is important to choose products that clearly label their ingredients and avoid those containing styrene.

Learn more \u2192 Ever think about how many products you reach for everyday, from cleaning products to cosmetics that may be doing more harm than good? The truth is,\u00a0toxic home products are more common than we realize quietly impacting human health. Toxins may lurk in everyday household products like cosmetics, cleaners, and even mattresses, affecting your health more than you think. Here's the good news: making a few simple swaps to your household products can go a long way in reducing your exposure to these harmful toxins. I myself have been making small swaps to non-toxic products over the years, and have never looked back! Learn how to identify 5 toxic everyday products you and I both likely usea nd swap them for safer, effective alternatives that are better for you, your home, and the planet.  We all love a fresh home, but most cleaning products and detergents are loaded with unnecessary toxins. These household chemicals get absorbed into our skin, contaminate our water systems, pollute our oceans and harm marine life. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are extremely common in conventional cleaning products and laundry detergents- one study reported 193 hazardous VOCs in 30 cleaning products. Linked to respiratory issues and cancer risk, VOCs are highly hazardous and negatively impact indoor and outdoor air quality. Triclosan is a pesticide and antimicrobial agent found in cleaning products, although restricted in soap, it is a known endocrine disruptor, irritating the skin and eyes Chlorine bleach is frequently used in cleaning and laundry products and as obvious as the odor it gives off, chlorine bleach is hazardous and highly toxic and as stated on the bottle it \"can cause severe burns to skin and eyes, blindness, and respiratory failure\" Other toxic substances found in these household cleaners are include phthalates, parabens, and more Safer Cleaning Products: Castile Soap* - this versatile vegetable soap is eco-friendly and gentle on your skin. It can be used for everything from dishwashing to all-purpose cleaning! There are also many non-toxic dish soaps to choose from! DIY all purpose cleaner - by mixing equal parts white vinegar and water, you have yourself a simple and effective cleaner. DIY laundry detergent - by combining soda crystals, bicarbonate of soda, castile soap, and boiling water you have an easy laundry solution! Soapnuts* are another natural detergent option Eco-friendly cleaners and detergents - Natural brands like Seventh Generation* or Truly Free* are fragrance free and void of harmful chemicals, and are available from many supermarkets - still keeping it convenient! Natural laundry solutions: Options such as soda crystals, bicarbonate of soda, and soapnuts* provide safe and effective laundry cleaning without harmful chemicals. Essential Oils in the Dryer: Instead of fabric softeners, use essential oils like lavender* on wool dryer balls *for natural scent and softening  When it comes to personal care, we are often quick to grab our favourite shampoo or moisturiser from the shelf without a second thought. However, hidden in these products are a host of chemicals, luckily there is a wealth of information to help you read ingredient lists, beauty certificates and decoder apps to inform you how harmful products are too! The Environmental Working Group (EWG) reported that American women use an average of 12 personal care products daily which contain approximately 168 different chemicals. US Researchers stated that 1 in 8 of the 82,000 ingredientsused in these toxic products are also industrial chemicals! PFAS (per- and porfluoroalkyl substances) or 'forever chemicals' are common in cosmetic products, to improve water-resistance and product texture. However, these chemicals can accumulate in the body causing immune system damage and an increased cancer risk Parabens (methyl-, propyl- and butylparaben) are preservatives used to extend the shelf-life of products and are found in many shampoos and cosmetics products. They are however, known endocrine disrupters and maybe potentially linked to breast cancer Phthalates (diethyl phthalate), used to help products like perfumes, nail polishes, hairsprays etc cling to the skin and be long-lasting. Phthalates have been reported to impact hormone and reproductive health and increase cancer risk Formaldehyde is a VOC found in many personal care products from eyelash glue to liquid baby soaps! Used extend a products shelf-life and prevent bacterial growth, this known carcinogen can also cause allergic skin reactions too Oxybenzone: Common in suncream and moisturisers with SPF, this UV filtering chemical is a suspected carcinogen and endocrine disrupters Safer Alternatives: The good news, is that you do not have to compromise on beauty or self-care, your favourite toxic-free alternative is waiting for you! Natural or Organic Skin Care - Look for body wash, and shampoo products that contain natural ingredients like shea butter, coconut and jojoba oils that can be implemented into your skincare routine Non-toxic makeup products - Brands like ILIA beauty, RMS beauty, Kosas, 100% Pure offer non-toxic alternatives for your makeup routine Natural deodorants- Explore more environmentally friendly and non-toxic deodorants like Fussy, Wild and AKT London Mineral sunscreens - Opt for suncreams with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, which although are thicker in texture are safer alternatives to chemical suncreams  A pleasant-smelling home is inviting, whether it's from an autumnal candle, or a clean burst of citrus from an air freshener but these seemingly harmless products composed of synthetic fragrance fill our air with hazardous chemicals that affect human health. Did you know that indoor pollution is the 8th most important risk factor, and accountable for 2.7% of the burden of disease globally, every year? Fragrance is found in most household products. Unfortunately, the term 'fragrance' or 'parfum' is not strictly regulated, allowing companies to avoid disclosing a full list of ingredients used in their formulations. Synthetic fragrance contain is a big concern for most people causing allergic reactions including contact dermatitis and asthma. Synthetic Fragrances: Lack of regulation allows the inclusion of toxic substances like benzene, toluene and formaldehyde , which can cause headaches, respiratory distress, and allergic reactions. VOCs from Paraffin Wax: When burned, candles made from paraffin release harmful VOCs that degrade indoor air quality. Phthlates are common in candles and air fresheners, serving to enhance and prolong the scent. However, these chemicals are associated with health risks including endocrine disruption and reproductive health issues. Safer Alternatives: Soy or beeswax candles are made from natural ingredients and burn cleaner. I used to rely on conventional candles, thinking they were harmless until I noticed how much they affected my allergies. Brands like Living Good Candle Co.*, Bluecorn *, Happy Organics* offer non-toxic candles, which create a cozy ambience, without the toxic fumes. Opt for safer alternatives like baking soda and vinegar, which naturally neutralize odors without harmful side effects. Essential Oil Diffusers, a great alternative to air fresheners, not only are they plant-derived but they offer potential therapeutic effects in a variety of scents without synthetic fragrance Homemade potpourri can keep your home smelling and looking lovely, by combining dried flowers, herbs, spices, and dehydrated fruit, you can generate your own natural signature home scent  Non-stick cookware is a stable in many kitchens, since being introduced 60 years ago they make-up 70% of cookware purchased today. However, the desirable non-stick effect of these pans comes with hidden affects on human health. Teflon, is most common non-stick coating is made from a chemical called polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and when heated, these chemicals break down releasing fumes like perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). When teflon is heated above 260\u00b0C, the toxic fumes released can cause flu-like symptoms in humans (Teflon flu), these fumes are also fatal to pets PFOA has been linked to hormone disruption, thyroid conditions, and even some cancers. Whilst this chemical is being faded out of newer cookware, watch out it could still be present in your older pans Safer Alternatives: Cast Iron: Durable and naturally non-stick when properly seasoned, cast iron cookware is a healthy and long-lasting alternative. Ceramic Cookware: Free from harmful chemicals, ceramic pans provide a safe cooking surface with effective non-stick properties. Stainless Steel: While not inherently non-stick, stainless steel cookware is free from toxic coatings and highly durable, making it a safe choice for various cooking needs. However, please note that often these pans require seasoning before use to activate the non-stick feature in these pans.  We often reach for cheap plastic containers and single-use water bottles without thinking about the consequences. However, these plastics come with their fair share of health and environmental issues. Global plastic production has reached 500 million metrics tons a year, 40% of this plastic is used for packaging, which includes food containers and water bottles. Plastics are made with an assortment of chemicals, a recent study reported that there are over 16,000 chemicals, with at least 4,200 of them contributing to serious health and environmental concerns. Some of the most common culprits are: BPA (bisphenol A) is one of the most commonly chemicals in plastic products, especially in single-use plastic food containers and water bottles. BPA can leach into food and drink, posing reproductive and fertility risks and as a oestrogen mimic, it can cause hormonal imbalances and can increase cancer risk Phthalates make plastics more flexible, and are commonly found in plastic food wrap and soft plastic food containers. Like BPA, they are linked to reproductive problems and certain cancers Antimony is a toxic heavy metal found in PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastic, it can leach in disposable water bottles, especially when heated. Many studies have linked antimony to organ toxicity and increased risk of cancer As we all know plastic poses a significant environmental concern, with every year 8 million metric tons of plastic waste enters the oceans. Plastic takes 450 years to decompose, and when exposed to sunlight, microplastics are formed, which release methane and ethylene, two of the most powerful greenhouse gases which contribute to climate change Safer Alternatives: Reusable non toxic water bottles - one of the easier swaps is ditching the single-used plastics water bottles and opting for a stainless steel or glass water bottle, they are durable, and keep your water tasting fresh Glass & Stainless steel food containers - when it comes to leftovers, swap out your old tupperware for a glass or stainless steel food container, both are long-lasting, and don't absorb stains or odors like plastic does Beeswax Wrap - are a great eco-friendly alternative to plastic wrap. I was at first skeptical at first, but after using them for a while, I am now a convert, they also add a bit of charm to your kitchen Reverse osmose filters - According to Dr. Andrew Huberman, \u2018 Tap water sources worldwide contain compounds that can impact our health, particularly endocrine disruptors.\u2019 By using a reverse osmosis filter, you can remove 99% of the waters contaminates, it is a game changer for people concerned about tap water quality, reverse osmose filters can drastically reduce these risks.  The good news is that by taking some simple precautions, you can significantly reduce your exposure to these harmful chemicals. Here are a few actionable tips: Read Labels Carefully: Before buying cleaning supplies, cosmetics, and other household products, always check the labels. Look for products that are free from VOCs, synthetic fragrances, irritants, and flammable ingredients. Prioritize items with clear, transparent labeling that includes certifications from reputable sources like MADE SAFE or EWG verified Use Reliable Resources: When choosing products, consult trustworthy sources like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Safer Choice list. These organizations rigorously test products for safety, ensuring they contain minimal harmful substances. By taking these steps, you can start creating a healthier environment for yourself and your family. Reduce Everyday exposure - many common household products from cleaning supplies to cosmetics contain harmful chemicals that negatively impact health. Embracing non-toxic living means making simple changes to reduce your exposure to these chemicals towards a healthier home Embrace Eco-friendly cleaners - Starting small you can swap conventional cleaners for safer alternatives like DIY cleaners, natural labels and castille soap Go natural in personal care - Organic skincare and non-toxic makeup is best for avoiding endocrine disruptors and other harmful ingredients Say No to plastic by opting for glass and stainless steel containers you can avoid toxic chemicals leeching into your food and drinks  If you enjoyed this post, check out these other articles on safe and non toxic products: Unmasking Toxins: Ingredients To Stay Away From In Makeup and Skincare Products A toxic household item is any product commonly found in homes that contains harmful chemicals capable of causing adverse health effects or environmental damage. These items often release hazardous substances such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), endocrine disruptors, or heavy metals during their use or disposal. Toxic household items can range from cleaning supplies and personal care products to cookware and plastic containers. Examples of toxic products include household cleaning agents such as bleach, ammonia, and drain cleaners. Personal care items like certain soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics may contain triclosan, a potentially hazardous antimicrobial agent Common toxic products available today include many mainstream cleaning products and detergents loaded with VOCs and other harmful chemicals. Personal care items like conventional shampoos, conditioners, and cosmetics often contain endocrine disruptors and carcinogens such as parabens and formaldehyde. Non-stick cookware is widely used despite the presence of PTFE and PFOA, which pose significant health risks. Additionally, everyday plastics like single-use water bottles, plastic wraps, and certain Tupperware containers frequently contain BPA and phthalates. Even widely used air fresheners and candles can emit toxic substances like benzene and toluene, contributing to indoor air pollution Millie Chamberlain is a passionate medical writer based in London.

While you carefully choose nutritious foods and safe toys, toxic clothing might be the hidden threat lurking in your child\u2019s wardrobe. Here's the raw truth: Many of our everyday clothes are packed with harmful chemicals - from toxic dyes to dangerous finishing agents. These aren't just abstract concerns - they're substances that touch our skin all day long, affecting our health and our children's wellbeing. How could this even be in children's clothing? As parents, we strive for the best for our children. Recognizing the dangers associated with synthetic fabrics isn't just important\u2014it's crucial for their well-being (and ours). In this article, \u2019ll uncover the hidden toxins in everyday wear and show you how to protect you and your child from these silent hazards. Toxic clothing refers to garments made from synthetic materials or treated with chemicals that can be harmful to human health. These fabrics might appear harmless, but they often contain substances that can be absorbed through the skin or inhaled, inhaled, or even ingested indirectly through environmental contamination. Toxic fashion is a growing concern due to the widespread use of synthetic fibers and chemical treatments in modern textiles. So, how widespread is this issue, and why should it matter to you? Understanding the prevalence of synthetic fabrics is the first step toward making safer choices for your family.\u00a0  Did you know that over 60% of clothing produced worldwide is made from synthetic fibers like polyester, nylon, and acrylic? These materials have become staples in the fashion industry because they\u2019re inexpensive and durable. However, their widespread use comes with hidden risks. A study found that phthalates, commonly used as plasticizers in textile industry, are present in concentrations of up to 33.42\u202f\u00b5g/g in children\u2019s clothing made from polyester, nylon, and spandex blends. These chemicals are linked to endocrine disruption and reproductive toxicity. In the mid-20th century, synthetic fabrics became popular as cost-effective and convenient alternatives to natural fibers. Innovations like polyester and nylon transformed the fashion industry by providing clothing that was wrinkle-free, easy to care for, and resistant to shrinking or fading. However, this convenience came with a hidden cost. At the time, the long-term health implications of wearing these materials were not fully understood. Now, we are beginning to see the effects, particularly on children, whose developing bodies are more susceptible to the potential toxins in these fabrics. As the fashion industry embraced synthetic materials, the manufacturing processes often involved the use of potentially harmful chemicals. These chemical substances, such as phthalates and formaldehyde, are used to enhance fabric performance but can pose significant health risks.  The rise of ultra fast fashion brands has further exacerbated the issue, as the demand for cheap, trendy clothing has led to increased production of synthetic fabrics. This surge in production often overlooks the environmental and health impacts, prioritizing speed and cost over safety. The fashion industry's supply chain is complex, with many stages where harmful chemicals can be introduced, from dyeing and finishing to the application of stain-resistant and anti-wrinkle treatments. For you and me, the challenge lies in identifying and avoiding toxic clothing. As you sort through your closet, you might notice labels like polyester, rayon, or nylon. These synthetic fabrics are more than just words on a tag\u2014they\u2019re potential sources of harmful chemicals that could affect your child\u2019s health. Polyester Polyester is everywhere, from T-shirts to school uniforms. It\u2019s popular because it\u2019s cheap and durable. However, during production, polyester is treated with chemicals like antimony, which is used as a catalyst. While antimony may not always be present in significant quantities in the final product, concerns arise from prolonged exposure to high concentrations. Moreover, polyester contributes to microfiber pollution when washed. A single machine wash can release up to 200,000 microplastic fibers into waterways. These microplastics carry toxic additives like phthalates and flame retardants, which accumulate in aquatic life and enter the food chain. Rayon Rayon production involves hazardous chemicals like carbon disulfide, sodium hydroxide, and sulfuric acid. Carbon disulfide exposure has been linked to neurological damage and reproductive harm. Acrylic Acrylic fabrics are made from polyacrylonitrile, which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies as a potential carcinogen. Also, like polyester, acrylic fabrics shed microplastics during washing, contributing to environmental pollution. Nylon Nylon is commonly used in swimwear and stockings. Its production involves various chemicals and can release nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. While formaldehyde is not always used in all nylon products, when present, it can cause itchy skin. Nylon garments also contribute to microfiber pollution, releasing tiny fibers that can carry toxic substances. Acetate Acetate and triacetate are chemically processed fabrics derived from wood pulp. The production involves solvents that can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. While these fabrics are considered less toxic than fully synthetic materials, they are not biodegradable and contribute to environmental pollution when discarded. It's not just the fabrics themselves that pose a risk; the additional chemical treatments applied to them can significantly contribute to the toxicity of clothing.  These treatments are often used to enhance fabric properties like water resistance, stain repellence, flame retardancy, and wrinkle resistance, but they come with their own set of health and environmental concerns.  Here are some of the most common and dangerous treatments applied to fabrics: Clothing labeled as wrinkle-free or stain-resistant often contains per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS chemicals are used in stain-resistant and wrinkle-free treatments for fabrics. These chemicals have been found in concentrations as high as 193 ng/g in polyester fabrics. PFAS exposure has been linked to immune system suppression, cancer, and reproductive harm. They\u2019re often referred to as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not break down in the environment and can accumulate over time in humans and wildlife. Flame retardants, particularly organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs), are commonly added to children\u2019s sleepwear for fire safety purposes. These chemicals can be absorbed through the skin and have been associated with hormone disruption, developmental issues, and neurotoxicity. Waterproof and water-resistant fabrics often contain perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), which are part of the broader PFAS family. These chemicals can off-gas or leach into the environment over time, leading to inhalation or dermal exposure. PFCs have been linked to various health problems such as liver damage, thyroid disease, decreased fertility, developmental issues in children, and certain cancers. Antimicrobial agents are incorporated into fabrics to inhibit bacterial growth and odors, commonly found in athletic wearand hospital textiles. Some include toxic chemicals like triclosan or silver nanoparticles. These substances can interfere with hormonal balance and contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance.  Let's quickly outline the most potent and harmful toxins commonly found in clothing and fabrics. Understanding the specific chemicals lurking in clothing can empower you to make safer choices for your family. Here\u2019s a rundown of the most hazardous substances commonly detected in textiles: Phthalates \u2022 Use: Plasticizers in synthetic fabrics like polyester to make them more flexible. \u2022 Health Risks: Endocrine disruption, reproductive issues, developmental problems, and increased cancer risk. Bisphenols (BPA and BPS) \u2022 Use: Enhance flexibility and durability of synthetic textiles. \u2022 Health Risks: Hormonal imbalances, reproductive harm, increased risk of conditions such as breast cancer. Formaldehyde \u2022 Use: Wrinkle-resistant treatments for fabrics. \u2022 Health Risks: Skin irritation, respiratory issues, and classified as a probable human carcinogen by the IARC. Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) \u2022 Use: Water-resistant, stain-repellent, and wrinkle-free clothing. \u2022 Health Risks: Immune system suppression, liver damage, developmental issues, and certain cancers. Azo Dyes \u2022 Use: Coloring textiles due to their bright colors. \u2022 Health Risks: Can break down into aromatic amines, which are carcinogenic. Associated with skin irritation and increased risk of bladder cancer. Toxic (heavy) Metals (Lead, Chromium, Cobalt) \u2022 Use: Dyes and finishes used in textiles. \u2022 Health Risks: Skin irritation, allergic reactions, organ damage, and cancer risk. Tributyl Phosphate (TBP) \u2022 Use: Flame retardant or plasticizer in clothing materials. \u2022 Health Risks: Skin irritant, respiratory issues upon prolonged inhalation. Dimethyl Fumarate (DMF) \u2022 Use: Anti-mold agent in clothing during storage or shipping. \u2022 Health Risks: Severe skin reactions like dermatitis; banned in many countries due to toxicity. Nonylphenol Ethoxylates (NPEs) \u2022 Use: Surfactants used during textile processing. \u2022 Health Risks: Disrupts endocrine function, persistent in the environment, bioaccumulates in aquatic organisms. Organophosphate Flame Retardants (OPFRs) \u2022 Use: Added to textiles for flame resistance. \u2022 Health Risks: Neurotoxicity, hormone disruption, developmental issues in children. Newer Generation PFAS While older types of PFAS are being phased out due to their toxicity, newer generation PFAS compounds are now being used as alternatives in many textiles. Unfortunately, these newer compounds may not be any safer than their predecessors. Emerging research suggests that newer generation PFAS still pose significant risks to human health and the environment due to their persistence and bioaccumulation properties. As a result, even garments labeled \"PFC-free\" may still contain other harmful perfluorinated compounds.  People may experience varying reactions when exposed to toxic chemicals in clothing. Individuals with conditions like multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) may be particularly vulnerable to even low levels of exposure from synthetic fabrics or treated garments.  Skin Absorption Your skin is a living, breathing organ that absorbs substances it contacts. Chemicals such as phthalates and bisphenols, often found in synthetic fabrics, can gradually be absorbed through the skin, especially when sweating. Off-Gassing Ever notice that \u201cnew clothes\u201d smell? That\u2019s often the result of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by synthetic materials or chemical treatments applied to fabrics during manufacturing. These gases can be inhaled, potentially causing respiratory issues, headaches, dizziness, and even long-term health effects like liver or kidney damage. Microfiber Pollution Washing synthetic clothes releases microplastic fibers into water systems (and our drinking water). These fibers carry toxic additives like phthalates and flame retardants, accumulating in marine life and eventually making their way back to us through the food chain.  Children are not just smaller versions of adults; their bodies are still developing. This ongoing growth makes them particularly vulnerable to toxins. Childrends skin absorbs substances more quickly, and their detoxification systems are not as efficient as adults, here\u00b4s why: Thinner Skin: Your child\u2019s skin is thinner and more permeable than yours. This means substances can pass through it more easily, allowing chemicals from fabrics to enter their bloodstream quicker. Immature Detox Systems: Their liver and kidneys, responsible for filtering out toxins, aren\u2019t fully developed. This makes it harder for their bodies to eliminate harmful substances efficiently. Rapid Growth: As they grow, their cells are dividing and developing at a rapid pace. Exposure to toxins during this critical period can interfere with normal development and potentially lead to long-term health issues. Over time, this can lead to a buildup of toxins that might affect their health in ways we\u2019re only beginning to understand. Kids will be kids\u2014that\u2019s part of their charm. But certain childhood behaviors can increase their exposure to harmful chemicals: \u2022 Mouthing Everything: Babies and toddlers explore the world with their mouths. Chewing on shirt sleeves, blankets, or toys made from synthetic materials can introduce toxins directly into their system. \u2022 Floor Play: They spend a lot of time crawling and playing on floors where dust and microfibers from synthetic clothing accumulate, leading to inhalation or ingestion of harmful particles. These behaviors are natural and essential for their development. The goal isn\u2019t to change how kids play but to ensure their environment\u2014including their clothing\u2014is as safe as possible.  Phthalates in Children\u2019s Clothing A study published in the Journal of Environmental Science found that children have higher concentrations of phthalates in their bodies compared to adults, partly due to exposure from clothing. Phthalates can be absorbed through the skin or inhaled from off-gassing materials, leading to potential developmental issues such as autism spectrum disorders and other neurodevelopmental delays. Phthalates have also been associated with reproductive problems and hormonal imbalances. Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals  A study published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) highlights the significant impact of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on children's health. EDCs, which are present in many synthetic fabrics and textile treatments, can interfere with hormone function, particularly during critical developmental stages. EDC exposure has been linked to thyroid disorders, obesity, diabetes, and altered adrenal hormone production in children. These chemicals are often found in clothing treated with flame retardants, water-resistant coatings, or plasticizers like phthalates. Pesticide Residues in Natural Fibers Even natural fibers like cotton may pose risks if they are not organically grown. Non-organic cotton is often treated with pesticides during cultivation, which can leave residues on the final fabric. Pesticide exposure has been linked to various health issues in children, including developmental delays, immune system dysfunction, and increased risk of cancer. Renowned environmental health expert Dr. Philip J. Landrigan, a pediatrician and epidemiologist, emphasizes: \u201cChildren are uniquely vulnerable to environmental toxins due to their developing systems and behaviors. Reducing their exposure to harmful chemicals is crucial for safeguarding their health.\u201d With growing concerns about toxic chemicals in clothing, it\u2019s comforting to know there are safer, more sustainable options out there. Let\u2019s explore some natural fabrics that are not only gentle on your and child\u2019s skin. Here\u2019s a breakdown of some of the best options that are both eco-friendly and free from harmful substances: Organic Cotton Why It\u2019s Safe: Organic cotton is grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. This means fewer harmful chemicals touching your child\u2019s delicate skin. Health Benefits: Soft, breathable, and hypoallergenic, organic cotton is perfect for sensitive skin.

Sustainability: Bamboo grows quickly without the need for pesticides or excessive water. It\u2019s one of the most sustainable fabric options available, making it a great choice for eco-conscious families. Linen and Hemp Why They\u2019re Safe: Linen and hemp are natural fibers requiring minimal chemical treatments. They\u2019re often grown with little to no pesticides, reducing harmful residues. Health Benefits: These fabrics are breathable and help regulate body temperature\u2014keeping your child cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Plus, they\u2019re naturally resistant to bacteria and mold. Sustainability: Linen and hemp need less water and can grow in poor soil conditions. Hemp, in particular, is known for restoring soil health, making these fabrics environmentally friendly choices. Wool and Silk Why They\u2019re Safe: When sourced ethically, wool and silk are free from harmful chemical treatments. They\u2019re natural fibers that have stood the test of time. Health Benefits: Wool is a fantastic insulator, keeping kids cozy in cold weather while still being breathable. Silk is gentle and soothing\u2014great for babies or children with eczema or sensitive skin. Sustainability: Wool and silk are renewable and biodegradable when produced responsibly. Choosing options like organic wool or peace silk ensures animal welfare and environmental care. Tencel (Lyocell) and Modal Why They\u2019re Safe: Made from sustainably sourced wood pulp, these fabrics use an eco-friendly closed-loop process that recycles water and solvents. Health Benefits: Tencel and Modal are smooth, breathable, and gentle on sensitive skin. Their excellent moisture-wicking properties keep active kids comfortable all day long. Sustainability: The production of these fabrics significantly reduces water usage and chemical waste compared to conventional methods. They\u2019re smart choices for both health and the environment.  Making the transition to safer, more sustainable clothing for your child might seem like a big task, but it doesn\u2019t have to be overwhelming. With a few practical steps, you can gradually shift to healthier options. Here\u2019s how to get started: Start with Essentials Begin by replacing items worn closest to the skin, like underwear and pajamas. These have the most prolonged skin contact and can make a significant difference. Consider replacing everyday items like T-shirts, leggings, and socks with options made from safe, natural materials. Budget-Friendly Strategies Switching to safer clothing doesn\u2019t have to strain your wallet. There are several ways to make eco-friendly choices more affordable. Shop Second-Hand Thrift Stores and Consignment Shops: Gently used clothing is not only budget-friendly but has often been washed multiple times, reducing any residual chemicals. You can find high-quality, natural fiber garments at a fraction of the cost. Online Marketplaces: Websites and apps dedicated to second-hand items make it easy to find what you need without leaving home. Invest in Quality Over QuantityFewer, higher-quality pieces can be more economical in the long run and better for your child\u2019s health. Choose Durable Fabrics: Natural fibers like organic cotton, hemp, and linen are often more durable than synthetics. Investing in well-made pieces means they\u2019ll last longer, even through the rough and tumble of childhood play. Versatile Wardrobe Staples: Select neutral colors and classic styles that can mix and match easily. This reduces the need for a large number of items and ensures your child gets plenty of use out of each piece. Support Ethical Brands Whenever possible, choose to buy from companies that prioritize safety, sustainability, and ethical production practices. \u2022 Research Brands: Look for transparency in how companies source their materials and manufacture their products. Brands that openly share this information are often more trustworthy. \u2022 Certifications to Look For: Sustainability certifications like GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and OEKO-TEX Standard 100 indicate that the fabrics meet strict safety and environmental criteria.

It\u2019s best to research specific materials and opt for natural fibers when possible. Check the clothing label for materials like polyester, nylon, acrylic, and chemical treatments like flame retardants. Certifications like GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) or OEKOTEX can help ensure fabric safety. Washing can remove some surface chemicals, but it won\u2019t eliminate toxins embedded in the fibers. Moreover, washing synthetic fabrics releases microplastics into waterways. Look for certifications like GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and OEKO-TEX Standard 100, which indicate that the fabric meets strict safety and environmental criteria. Synthetic fabrics like polyester, nylon, and spandex are more likely to be treated with PFAS-based coatings. Clothing that is labeled as \"water-resistant,\" \"stain-repellent,\" \"wrinkle-free,\" or \"durable water repellent (DWR)\" most likely contain PFAS. These treatments are often applied to outdoor gear like hiking pants, jackets, and sportswear to improve performance. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only.

Many popular companies rely on synthetic fabrics that may not only harm the planet but could also be affecting our bodies. A recent report highlighted that some sports bras and leggings could expose us to up to 40 times the safe limit of BPA\u2014a chemical tied to health issues like asthma and heart disease. That was a wake-up call for me. Every time we sweat, those chemicals may be transferring to our skin, which is why switching to non-toxic activewear feels less like a trend and more like a wellness essential. In this article, we\u2019ve carefully selected 11 nontoxic activewear brands that prioritize your health, the environment, and\u2014of course\u2014style. Whether you\u2019re aiming for high performance, eco-conscious fabrics, or all-day comfort, these brands have you covered with workout gear that aligns with your values Non-toxic activewear refers to workout clothes that are free of common toxic chemicals found in regular athletic wear, such as Bisphenols, PFAS, phthalates, flame retardants, and formaldehyde. While they offer flexibility, they also come with enormous downsides for the environment and our health. By choosing BPA and PFAS-free workout gear, you\u2019re opting for safer, more natural and organic materials like organic cotton, Tencel, merino wool, and bamboo. Natural Fibers: Materials like organic cotton, merino wool, and bamboo are grown without harmful pesticides and processed without toxic chemicals. Derived from sustainably managed forests, new fibers on the market like Tencel and Modal offer softness, durability, and biodegradability. Chemical-Free Dyes: Non-toxic activewear brands often use natural or low-impact dyes to minimize skin irritation and environmental harm. Sustainable Production: Ethical manufacturing practices that reduce environmental footprint and ensure safe working conditions. Non-toxic activewear keeps you comfortable naturally. Fabrics like organic cotton, bamboo, and Tencel are soft, breathable, and gentle on your skin, while merino wool helps regulate temperature and wicks away moisture. Together, these materials reduce the risk of skin irritation and overheating, letting you focus on your workout without worry. Opting for non-toxic sports bras or non-toxic leggings may seem like a mere trend, but it actually has many benefits for your health and the environment. Let's explore why it is important to switch to chemical-free clothing and make your gym routine a bit more healthy and eco-friendly!  Most workout clothes are made from synthetic plastic fibers like polyester, spandex, nylon, or elastane. While these fabrics offer great moisture-wicking properties and flexibility, they come with several problems for the environment and your body, such as: Microplastics: Every time you wash your workout clothes, these e synthetic fibers release microplastics into water streams and contribute to plastic pollution. Resource-Intensive Production: Synthetic fabrics often rely on non-renewable resources and consume significant energy during manufacturing. Harmful Chemicals: Many of these fabrics contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as: Forever Chemicals (PFAS): PFAS are known as \"forever chemicals\" due to their persistence in the environment and have been linked to serious health conditions including cancer and reproductive harm. A study found that25% of tested workout leggings and yoga pants contained detectable levels of organic fluorine, an indicator of PFAS, with concentrations ranging from 10 ppm to 284 ppm. BPA: An endocrine disruptor associated with reproductive issues and metabolic disorders. Toxic Dyes and Phthalates: Can cause skin irritation, allergies, and long-term health effects. Mohamed Abdallah, an associate professor at the University of Birmingham, explains that your skin is exposed to these chemicals every time you wear synthetic workout clothes, and sweating may increase the absorption rate. In simple words, these toxic chemicals in clothing can go from causing contact dermatitis to interfering with your endocrine system, potentially leading to more serious issues. You want an outfit that not only looks good but also performs well during your workout\u2014without having to worry about harmful chemicals seeping into your skin as you sweat. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve curated a list of the best non-toxic activewear brands to help you enjoy a healthier, stress-free workout.

To ensure you are investing in genuinely non-toxic activewear, consider the following: Look for Certifications and Standards for Non-Toxic FabricsTo ensure the authenticity of non-toxic claims, look for certifications such as: Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS): Ensures organic status of textiles, from harvesting of raw materials to environmentally and socially responsible manufacturing. OEKO-TEX Standard 100: Certifies that textiles are free from harmful levels of more than 100 substances known to be detrimental to human health. Bluesign\u00ae: Focuses on sustainable and safe production processes, minimizing environmental impact. Research Brands:Look into each brand\u2019s commitment to sustainable and ethical practices. Read LabelsUnderstand the materials used and avoid products with ambiguous or misleading claims about their safety and environmental impact. Second-hand activewear is a great way to reduce your environmental impact while supporting slow fashion. Opt for pre-loved pieces made from natural materials, keeping high-quality items out of landfills and minimizing the production demand for new clothes. Healthier Workout Gear: Non-toxic activewear avoids chemicals like BPA and PFAS, reducing health risks from synthetic materials. Better Fabrics: Natural, eco-friendly materials like organic cotton, Tencel, and merino wool offer breathability and comfort, protecting your skin. Supporting a Healthier Planet: Choosing non-toxic brands with eco-friendly materials and transparent supply chain helps reduce pollution and promotes sustainable practices. Smart Investment: Non-toxic activewear lasts longer, helping you save money over time and build a healthier workout wardrobe with less waste. Certifications Matter: Look for trusted certifications (GOTS, OEKO-TEX) to ensure safe, eco-conscious products.  Top choices are natural, undyed fabrics like organic cotton, silk, linen, hemp, and Tencel. Look for GOTS or OEKO-TEX certifications to ensure safety from harmful chemicals.

But here\u2019s the kicker: Unless your rocking non toxic sports bras, you could be counteracting a lot of that good! Sure, working out is great for our body and mind, but if we're wearing gear loaded with nasty chemicals, we're not really doing ourselves any favors. In this article, we'll get into nontoxic sports bras and how they can genuinely support our health. Plus, we'll break down what makes those regular sports bras not-so-great. And because we love finding the best options for non toxic living, we\u2019ve rounded up our top picks for non-toxic alternatives to keep us comfy and chemical-free. Conventional sports bras may look good on those toned bods, but they often come with hidden risks\u2014synthetic fabrics and chemicals that can irritate your skin and expose you to toxins. That is definitely not sexy. Here\u2019s why making the switch to non-toxic options is worth it: Hidden BPA Dangers: Did you know that some sports bras can expose you to up to 40 times the safe limit of BPA? This chemical, often found in plastic water bottles, can also lurk in synthetic sports bras, leading to potential hormone disruption . Pesticides in Fabrics: Non-organic fabrics, particularly cotton, are often treated with pesticides. In fact, seven of the 15 pesticides commonly used on cotton in the U.S. are listed as \u201cprobable\u201d or \u201cknown\u201d human carcinogens by the EPA . PFAS and Forever Chemicals: Many synthetic sports bras are treated with PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) to make them moisture-resistant. These \u201cforever chemicals\u201d don\u2019t break down in the environment and have been linked to immune system suppression, increased cholesterol levels, and even certain cancers. Microplastics in Your Laundry: Washing synthetic fabrics, including many conventional sports bras, can release microplastics into our waterways. These tiny plastic particles are not only harmful to marine life but can also make their way back into our food and water supply. Switching to non-toxic sports bras made from natural fibers or recycled materials means you\u2019re not just protecting your health\u2014you\u2019re also making a choice that\u2019s better for the planet.

We wear them ourselves during various workouts\u2014hot yoga, running, HIIT, and even just house loungin'\u2014to see how they hold up in real-life scenarios. This hands-on approach helps us ensure that each bra isn\u2019t just non-toxic but also comfortable and effective. We\u2019ve carefully curated our recommendations into two categories\u2014\"Best\" and \"Better\" \"Best\" products are our top picks for non-toxic sports bras. These options are sustainable sports bras made from natural materials like organic cotton and bamboo, which are inherently non-toxic. We\u2019ve chosen these because they offer not only the best in safety but also a comfortable, skin-friendly experience. \"Better\" products are still great choices. While they may be made from synthetic fabrics, they meet high standards for sustainability, so we wanted to include them in this list. These are perfect for those who might be okay with a bit of synthetic material as long as the product is created with environmental health in mind. We know finding the right balance between sustainability and performance can be tricky, so we hope these options help you feel good about your choice, both in and out of the gym.

We love adding it to our list as a statement that big brands are starting to take note of what we care about. It\u2019s a small step, but it shows that our choices are making a difference. Shop Jockey here*\u00a0  Image @ Jockey When we think about sports bras, we're usually focused on finding that perfect blend of support and comfort. But here's something unexpected\u2014many sports bras are hiding some pretty toxic secrets. Those stretchy, durable fabrics like polyester and spandex often come with a side of harmful chemicals, including dyes, formaldehyde, and even the notorious PFAS, also known as \u201cforever chemicals.\u201d While these materials give us the performance we crave, they also make us wonder, what exactly are we putting next to our skin? And let\u2019s not forget the environmental impact. It\u2019s a good reminder that our workout gear deserves as much scrutiny as our skincare, and maybe it\u2019s time to consider more sustainable, non-toxic options that love our bodies and the planet back. PFAS, or \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d are often used in sports bras to make fabrics more durable and moisture-resistant. But the problem is, these chemicals don\u2019t just stay in the fabric. When we sweat during a workout, PFAS can transfer from our bras to our skin, potentially making their way into our bodies. That\u2019s concerning, given PFAS have been linked to hormone disruption, immune issues, and even certain cancers. When it comes to the safety of your baby, every choice matters\u2014especially what you wear close to your skin. Unfortunately, not enough research has been done to determine the safety of wearing clothing that contains PFAS on the breasts while nursing. These chemicals, often found in water-resistant or stain-resistant fabrics, have been linked to potential health risks, and we believe it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. Given the lack of comprehensive testing, we recommend opting for non-toxic, PFAS-free bras and clothing during your nursing journey. This ensures that your baby is only exposed to the safest, most natural materials, allowing you to focus on what matters most\u2014nurturing your little one. Polyester and nylon are the go-tos for durable and supportive sports bras, but here\u2019s the catch\u2014they take hundreds of years to break down in landfills. That\u2019s a huge environmental issue. Like really HUGE. Recycled materials, like recycled nylon and those made from PET bottles, offer a better alternative for those of us prioritizing sustainability. However, they can still carry some of the same harmful chemicals. So, while recycled fabrics are a step in the right direction, we need to be mindful of the trade-offs between sustainability and potential chemical exposure. When it comes to sports bras and other athletic clothing like leggings for that matter, organic cotton, bamboo, and merino wool are the real MVPs. These materials are not only soft and breathable, but they\u2019re also free from harmful chemicals, making them a healthier choice for our skin. Plus, their manufacturing processes are far more sustainable\u2014especially with organic options that avoid toxic pesticides. Regenerative farming practices? That's like organic plus! Choosing these fabrics means we\u2019re doing good for our bodies and the planet, one workout at a time. GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard), OEKO-TEX, Fair Trade Certified, and B Corp ensure that sports bras are non-toxic, ethically produced, and environmentally responsible. GOTS ensures the use of organic fibers, OEKO-TEX certifies that the textiles are free from harmful substances, Fair Trade Certified ensures ethical labor practices, and B Corp focuses on social and environmental responsibility. Many conventional sports bras contain synthetic fabrics and chemicals like PFAS, which can pose health risks, especially when they come into contact with sweat. For nursing mothers, this exposure can be particularly concerning. While recycled materials offer a more sustainable option, they still may carry harmful chemicals. Organic cotton, bamboo, and merino wool are healthier alternatives, providing softness, breathability, and reduced chemical exposure. Ready to make a change? Switch to non-toxic sports bras made from natural or recycled materials to protect your health and support sustainable practices. Your choices are making a difference! If you enjoyed this post, check out these other articles on safe and non toxic products: Best Non-Toxic Activewear Brands for a Healthier Workout Not all sports bras contain BPA, but some may, especially if they are made from certain synthetic materials. BPA is a chemical often found in plastics and synthetic fibers, so it's possible for some sports bras to contain it. High levels of toxic chemicals in sports bras can include PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), formaldehyde, and BPA, which are linked to health risks like hormone disruption. Organic cotton is considered one of the safest bra materials due to its natural, chemical-free properties. Bamboo and merino wool are also regarded as safe materials because they are natural and typically involve fewer chemicals in their processing. Some sports bras do contain PFAS, especially those made from moisture-resistant synthetic fabrics. Yes, Boody\u2019s bamboo-based fabrics are BPA-free and made with eco-friendly practices. While not all spandex contains BPA, some synthetic blends might include it. BPA is not an inherent component of spandex but can be present in certain manufacturing processes. Yes, BPA can be absorbed through the skin from clothing, particularly when there is sweat or prolonged contact.

I didn\u2019t, either\u2014until I found out that a lot of leggings are made with synthetic materials that contain harmful chemicals. These can irritate your skin, mess with your hormones, and even pose bigger health risks. But here\u2019s the good news: switching to non-toxic leggings can make a huge difference for both your health and the planet. In this post, I\u2019ll share some of the best non-toxic leggings out there\u2014 that not only feel great but are also free from the nasty stuff. Whether you\u2019re working out, running errands, or just relaxing at home, you can stay comfortable and confident knowing your leggings are good for you and the environment.  Did you know your favorite leggings might be hiding some harmful chemicals? Many conventional leggings are made from synthetic fabrics like spandex, nylon, and polyester\u2014essentially plastics. These materials often contain chemicals like dyes, flame retardants, PFAS, and petroleum products that can harm your health. When you sweat, your skin absorbs these chemicals more easily. Activewear, in particular, is notorious for containing toxins that can lead to issues like hormonal disruptions, skin irritation, and even an increased risk of cancer. So, what exactly is hiding in your leggings? Formaldehyde: A colorless, odorless chemical often used in textiles, can lead to nausea, skin irritation, burning sensations, and even certain cancers. BPA: A chemical compound used to make plastic, linked to a myriad of health issues like asthma, cardiovascular disease, reproductive issues, obesity, and certain cancers. PFAS:\u00a0 These \u201cforever chemicals\u201d are practically everywhere (including the Arctic!)\u00a0and have been linked to health risks like kidney and testicular cancers.\u00a0 Heavy Metals: Found in dyes and synthetic fibers, heavy metals can be absorbed through the skin, leading to abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and long-term damage to the kidneys and liver. Organotins: Used in some textiles, these chemical compounds have neurotoxic properties and can cause skin irritation, endocrine disruption, and hormonal imbalances. Phthalates: These plasticizers, used to make fabrics more flexible, are often found in textiles. Exposure can result in respiratory issues, skin sensitization, and metabolic disorders. Perfluorinated Chemicals (PFCs): Commonly used to make fabrics water-resistant, PFCs have been linked to reduced immunity, liver damage, and increased risks of cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. That\u2019s why switching to toxin free organic cotton leggings is a game-changer.\u00a0 Toxin free leggings are typically crafted from organic materials that steer clear of the harmful chemicals mentioned earlier, making them safer for your skin and better for the planet. Organic cotton, for instance, is not only soft and breathable, but it\u2019s also grown without harmful pesticides or fertilizers. This ensures that your skin is less exposed to toxins and allergens, offering a healthier, more eco-friendly option for activewear. Non-toxic dyes are another key benefit, reducing the risk of allergic reactions, while the natural fibers in organic cotton make the fabric more durable and luxurious. These leggings last longer, feel more comfortable, and don\u2019t come with the hidden health risks associated with synthetic materials. When shopping for nontoxic or organic leggings, look for options made from sustainable materials like organic cotton, hemp, bamboo, natural rubber and using plant-based dyes. Natural fiber\u00a0provides a skin-friendly, cozy experience without the worry of chemical exposure. So why settle for harmful chemicals when you can choose leggings that are comfortable, eco-friendly, and toxin-free?

Image @ Tentree This were the best non-toxic leggings from trusted brands. There are plenty of other fantastic brands out there like Manduka, Ecoalf, and Organic Basics that offer non-toxic, sustainable leggings made from eco-friendly materials. However, it\u2019s always essential to check the labels and certifications to ensure you\u2019re truly getting toxin-free, organic products. Here\u2019s how you can make sure you\u2019re choosing the best non-toxic leggings for your body and the planet: There are tons of non-toxic legging options on the market now, and demand will only grow from here. But how can you find the best leggings in this ever-growing catalog?\u00a0 Look for Certifications: Ensure your leggings are certified by reputable organizations like GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard), OEKO-TEX, B Corp, or Blue Design, which guarantee that the product meets high environmental and safety standards. Check the Label: Avoid leggings with synthetic fibers like polyester, nylon, and spandex. Instead, opt for 100% organic cotton or blends with natural fibers like bamboo or hemp. Consider the Production Process: Brands that are transparent about their production process are often more trustworthy. Look for companies that use eco-friendly dyes and ethical manufacturing practices. Read Reviews: Customer reviews can provide insights into the comfort, durability, and fit of the leggings. Look for feedback on how the leggings perform in various activities like yoga, running, or lounging.  First thing first: you CAN wash your leggings in your washing machine! That being said, if you choose to go this route, be sure to use the gentle cycle, use ONLY cold water and if possible use a non toxic laundry detergent, that\u00b4s gentle to your skin and the planet. Now the bad news: you shouldn\u2019t use your dryer. The heat and tumbling can do a number on your leggings, so for the best results, you should air dry your leggings to help preserve your fabric.\u00a0 You can majorly extend the lift of your non-toxic leggings by giving them proper care right off the bat. Some other key tips include:\u00a0 Avoid fabric softener. Don\u2019t over-dry (air-dry only). Fold them neatly after drying (don't crumple them in a heap!) Store them in a cool, dry place. Conventional Leggings Risks: Made from synthetic fabrics like spandex, nylon, and polyester, they contain harmful chemicals like BPA, PFAS, and flame retardants, which can be absorbed by the skin and cause health issues. Organic Cotton Benefits: Non-toxic, soft, breathable, and durable. Grown without harmful chemicals, making it safer for sensitive skin and better for the environment. Certifications: Look for GOTS, OEKO-TEX, Fair Trade, and B Corp for assurance of safety and ethical practices.  The things that we put on our bodies matter, now more than ever. If you\u2019re looking to make the switch to more sustainable and healthy clothing options, you have a plethora of options to choose from, but non toxic leggings\u2014especially organic cotton leggings\u2014are a wonderful place to start.\u00a0 For your next pair of leggings, you deserve to splurge a little and opt for non toxic ingredients like organic cotton and other PFAS free materials that still feel good on your skin. And most of all, you deserve to feel good in your own skin, especially when it's wrapped in the favorite piece of clothing in your closet!

For truly PFAS-free leggings, look for leggings that are made with natural materials like cotton. Many brands are starting to advertise that their products are PFAS-free, but a handy list can be found at EWG. Of course, being PFAS free is only the beginning\u2014there are many other synthetic materials (like microplastics) that still a danger to human health. If you like to wear your leggings out on the town, you may be wondering if the organic cotton alternatives will still weather the elements. While organic cotton leggings may not repel water as easily, they are still incredibly breathable and moisture-wicking, which means you can still opt for organic cotton leggings without getting bogged down. The compounds in polyester actually come from crude oil\u2013which means those deceptively soft fibers are made from petroleum. Every time you wash a polyester garment, it releases thousands of tiny synthetic fibers, which ultimately leads to widespread microplastic pollution.\u00a0 Additionally, polyester is not a very breathable material, which means it traps heat and makes you swear. The more you sweat, the more the oils in your sweat break down the oil-based materials in your clothing, which means you absorb more of those tiny particles in your skin. Leggings made from recycled materials (like recycled polyester and recycled nylon) may be slightly better for the environment, but when it comes to human health, these materials are still bad news. Non toxic clothing should be made of natural, organic materials. Avoid synthetic materials like polyester and nylon and opt instead of clothing either made of plant-based fibers (cotton, linen, and hemp) or some animal-based fibers (like wool, silk, and cashmere). These materials are biodegradable, have a lower carbon footprint, and don't come with the same health risks (which range from dermatitis to cancer!) Also look for certifications such as GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and OEKO-TEX\u00ae which guarantee that the fabrics are free from harmful chemicals. Yes! Cotton is a good choice for any exercise activity. It's fairly lightweight and breathable, which means you can keep cool while working up a sweat. Organic cotton is also fairly soft and malleable, which gives you a full range of motion whether in the Pilates studio or just out on the town. Organic cotton yoga leggings are a perfect alternative to other activewear options. *The links are so-called 'affiliate links.'

The jewelry industry has a negative environmental impact, including air and water pollution, deforestation, soil degradation and more. One mined carat of gold releases 57 kg of carbon, making sustainability issues within this industry a real concern. Sustainable jewelry helps to reduce waste, conserve resources and promote responsible sourcing and production, resulting in a reduced environmental impact. Sustainable jewelry typically consists of recycled gold, silver and bronze, as well as lab-grown diamonds and gemstones. Keep up the great work! Thank you so much for sharing a great posts.

As someone navigating perimenopause, I\u2019ve tried it all\u2014meditation apps, herbal teas, melatonin drops, herbal pills... But nothing worked consistently until I discovered weighted comforters. However, most weighted blankets come with a hidden downside: synthetic materials and questionable chemicals. Since we spend a third of our lives in bed, what we wrap ourselves in matters deeply. After thorough research, I invested in the Baloo Weighted Blanket, known for its chemical free, non-toxic materials and sustainable design. For this Baloo Weighted Blanket review, I put this premium blanket to the test for 90 nights. Here\u2019s everything I learned\u2014the good, the bad, and how it stacks up against competitors like Bearaby* or Luna, \u2014so you can decide if it\u2019s the right choice for you.  The Baloo Weighted Blanket is crafted for those who value a non-toxic, eco-friendly sleep environment. Unlike many weighted blankets that may contain synthetic fillers or harmful chemicals and trap heat, Baloo prioritizes chemical-free, sustainably sourced, breathable natural materials,\u00a0making it a healthier option for your body and peace of mind. It\u2019s Oeko-Tex-certified, ensuring it\u2019s free from harmful substances like formaldehyde and phthalates. In the words of the company itself, \u201cBaloo is committed to creating products that support your well-being and the health of the planet. We use only natural materials, like 100% cotton and lead-free glass beads, to ensure our blankets are safe, sustainable, and breathable for everyone.\u201d This commitment is evident in every aspect of the blanket\u2019s design, from its chemical-free cotton fabric to the use of lead-free glass beads for weight distribution. Baloo offers a variety of sizes and weights: You can choose from Throw, Full/Queen, and King sizes, with weight options ranging from 12 to 25 lbs. I initially opted for the smallest and lightest version, thinking it would be a safer investment. \u00a0In hindsight, I should have gone for a larger size, which would have been more versatile for my needs. For the colors, I opted for the Silver Sage color, and it blends beautifully with my home decor! Additionally, Baloo offers an optional duvet cover made of equally breathable, natural materials, ensuring easy customization and maintenance. Use ORBASICS12 for 12% off.  Unboxing the Baloo Weighted Blanket was an experience in itself. The thoughtful, plastic-free packaging immediately set the tone for the brand\u2019s commitment to sustainability. The blanket came in a charming cotton bag that I\u2019ve since reused for grocery shopping\u2014practical and eco-friendly. Materials: 1Made entirely of 100% organic cotton with a soft, smooth texture that feels natural and breathable. Design: The sleek, understated quilting gives it a timeless, high-end look, far removed from the bulky, utilitarian feel of some other weighted blankets. Weight Distribution: The lead-free glass microbeads are evenly spread across double-stitched pockets, ensuring no clumping or shifting over time. This durability is unmatched by lower-cost options I\u2019ve tried. Packaging: No plastics were used; the blanket came in a charming cotton bag that can be reused for grocery shopping. Unlike the synthetic, plasticky feel of cheaper options, the Baloo blanket exudes quality and comfort. But its true test would come at night. From the very first night, I knew this blanket was different. The lead-free glass beads provided a gentle, evenly distributed weight that felt calming and grounding without being overpowering. Surprisingly, I didn\u2019t need any adjustment period\u2014it just worked. Here\u2019s what I noticed right away: \u2022 I fell asleep within 15 minutes (a huge improvement from my usual hour of tossing and turning). \u2022 My nights were markedly more restful, with fewer wake-ups. \u2022 Beyond sleep, I found myself reaching for the blanket during couch time or whenever I felt a little anxious or restless\u2014it\u2019s like a hug that melts away stress. With a 12lb weight (perfect for my 68kg/150lbs body weight), the blanket offered just the right amount of pressure to relax without discomfort. It\u2019s become my go-to for winding down, whether I\u2019m in bed or enjoying a cozy evening on the couch.  As I continued using the Baloo Weighted Blanket, the benefits became even more apparent: Deeper Sleep: My sleep tracker revealed a consistent 45-minute increase in deep sleep per night, leaving me feeling more refreshed in the mornings. Reduced Night Sweats: As someone prone to overheating, I was relieved to experience significantly fewer night sweats, thanks to the breathable cotton. Morning Calm: I woke up feeling less anxious and more ready to take on the day\u2014a huge shift from my usual grogginess. After consistent use, the benefits were undeniable: Faster Sleep Onset: Falling asleep in under 10 minutes became my new normal. No More Sleep Aids: I stopped needing melatonin or other sleep aids entirely\u2014the blanket provided all the comfort I needed. Improved Mood: My overall mood improved noticeably, with a drop in morning anxiety. Better sleep truly transformed my days. In the photos I\u2019m using my 12 lb throw Baloo weighted blanket without the cover on. The Baloo Weighted Blanket stands out for its thoughtful design, superior materials, and attention to sustainability. After testing weigthed blankets by competitors like Bearaby*, Gravity*, Silk & Snow, and Luna*, I can confidently say that Baloo delivers a premium experience that justifies its higher price point. Use\u00a0ORBASICS12 for 12% off  Baloo is undoubtedly a premium product, and when compared to popular brands like Bearaby* and Luna*, its strengths become even clearer. \u2022 Material: Baloo uses cotton and lead-free glass beads, while Bearaby* is made entirely of hand-knit organic cotton for both structure and weight. \u2022 Weight Distribution: Baloo excels in even weight distribution, while Bearaby\u2019s* open-knit design can stretch over time. \u2022 Style: If aesthetics are a priority, Bearaby\u2019*s chunky-knit style is undeniably eye-catching, but Baloo\u2019s classic, quilted look offers timeless elegance. \u2022 Price: Baloo\u2019s range of $188\u2013$459 is slightly higher than Bearaby\u2019s* $199\u2013$259, but Baloo provides more weight options and is fully machine washable for easier maintenance. \u2022 Price: Luna\u2019s budget-friendly range of $49.99\u2013$98.99 makes it an accessible choice for first-time users. However, Baloo\u2019s superior materials and build quality justify the higher cost. \u2022 Materials: Both brands use non-toxic materials, but Baloo\u2019s premium organic cotton and lead-free glass beads feel more luxurious and eco-conscious. \u2022 Durability: Baloo outshines Luna* when it comes to durability, with its double-quilted design preventing the bead shifting that often occurs in Luna* blankets. If you\u2019re seeking a weighted blanket that combines luxury, sustainability, and functionality, Baloo is a standout choice. While its higher price might give you pause, the exceptional craftsmanship, breathability, and long-lasting quality make it a worthwhile investment for restful nights and improved well-being.  The Baloo Weighted Blanket is ideal for individuals seeking a sustainable, non-toxic option that balances comfort and breathability without compromising on quality. It\u2019s particularly well-suited for hot sleepers and those who value easy maintenance and compact storage. Hot Sleepers: The breathable cotton fabric ensures comfort without overheating, making it a perfect companion for warm nights or those prone to night sweats. Clean Living Enthusiasts: If you value non-toxic materials and want to avoid synthetic fillers or harmful chemicals, Baloo is an outstanding option. Durability Seekers: With its high-quality construction and machine-washable design, it\u2019s ideal for those looking for a long-lasting, low-maintenance weighted blanket. You Prefer a Chunky Knit Style: If aesthetics are a priority, brands like Bearaby weighted blanket or Silk & Snow* may be more appealing with their bold, hand-knit designs. You\u2019re on a Tight Budget: For first-time users or those hesitant to invest, Luna* offers a more affordable option with decent quality. Weighted blankets leverage Deep Pressure Stimulation (DPS) to calm the nervous system and enhance relaxation, mimicking the soothing effect of a hug. Backed by research, they can: \u2022 Reduce stress and anxiety: By lowering cortisol levels (the stress hormone) and boosting serotonin and oxytocin, weighted blankets promote feelings of calm. \u2022 Improve sleep quality: Studies show they increase melatonin (the sleep hormone) and reduce nighttime restlessness. \u2022 Support mental health: Proven benefits for individuals with ADHD, autism, and sensory sensitivities include better emotional regulation and reduced anxiety. However, the materials matter. Conventional blankets often contain harmful chemicals like flame retardants or synthetic fillers, which may off-gas or irritate sensitive skin, and even disrupt our hormone balance. Opting for non-toxic options, like those certified by OEKO-TEX\u00ae, ensures better health and eco-consciousness.  After three months of consistent use, I can confidently say the Baloo Weighted Blanket is a high-quality, luxury weighted blanket and lives up to its reputation. While it may be considered as one of the most expensive weighted blankets, ts exceptional quality, craftsmanship, non-toxic materials, and transformative sleep benefits make it worth every penny. Here\u2019s why: The quilted design keeps the glass beads evenly distributed, ensuring a smooth and comfortable surface throughout the night. It\u2019s versatile enough for both bedtime use and cozy couch sessions, making it a functional addition to your home and ideal for anyone looking for a high-quality weighted blanket The non-toxic materials and eco-friendly practices give peace of mind, especially if you\u2019re sensitive to synthetic materials or harsh chemicals. While I wish for more color options, it\u2019s the best weighted blanket I\u2019ve tried, hands down.

We may earn a commission on purchases, at no additional cost to you. Learn more \u2192 My journey with\u00a0Primally Pure* started when I was deep into researching clean beauty products. I\u2019d been hunting for natural products that were genuinely non-toxic, effective, and natural\u2014a difficult combination to find. So many brands out there promise \u201cnatural\u201d ingredients, yet a closer look at the label often tells a different story, with sneaky toxic chemicals hidden in fine print. When I came across Primally Pure, I felt like I\u2019d found something different. I care deeply about what goes on my skin, especially since switching (gradually) to a non-toxic lifestyle, so I wanted to test if Primally Pure lived up to the hype. I couldn\u2019t wait to see how their products worked in my routine. I tested these three Primally Pure essentials: the Unscented Sensitive Deodorant, Plumping Face Mask, and Plumping Serum. Each of these promised something unique\u2014gentle, natural care with clean, recognizable ingredients. In this review, I\u2019ll dive into my personal experience with each of these products\u2014the good, the not-so-good, and whether they\u2019re worth a spot in your natural skincare routine, especially if you\u2019re dealing with sensitive skin conditions.  What drew me in was how simple and straightforward Primally Pure\u2019s approach is\u2014no endless lists of \u201cgreenwashed\u201d ingredients or overwhelming options. I noticed right away that their products were formulated with minimal, recognizable ingredients. To start, I chose the Unscented Sensitive Deodorant*, the Plumping Face Mask*, and the Plumping Serum*. I was especially excited about the deodorant. Finding a natural deodorant that actually works and doesn\u2019t irritate my skin has been an endless journey (and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone here!). With the face mask and serum, I was curious if they could deliver on the hydration and plumping effects they promised without being overly heavy or greasy\u2014especially on my aging skin, which craves nourishment, hydration, and a bit of that youthful plumpness. I\u2019ll share my honest impressions of how each one performed, what I loved, and any quirks that came along with them. Let\u2019s go! Here, I\u2019ll walk you through my experience with three of Primally Pure\u2019s top products: the Unscented Sensitive Deodorant, Plumping Face Mask, and Plumping Serum. Each product is carefully crafted, and I\u2019ll share how they performed for me, as well as some tips on how to get the best results from each. If you\u2019ve tried natural deodorants before, you probably know it\u2019s a journey. Some work for a day, others leave skin irritated, and many just don\u2019t quite deliver. I usually opt for scented deodorants to help mask any odor, so I was a bit skeptical about going unscented. With an unscented option, there\u2019s nothing to \u201ccover up\u201d odor\u2014so it really has to work. So Primally Pure\u2019s Unscented Sensitive Deodorant was definitely a game-changer for me. Bethany McDaniel, the founder, has said, \u201cWe wanted to create something gentle enough for all skin types but tough enough to really work\u201d\u2014and for me, it definitely lived up to that promise. This formula combines baking soda, coconut oil, organic arrowroot powder, non-nano zinc oxide, and kaolin clay for strong odor protection without essential oils or artificial fragrances that can irritate sensitive skin. From day one, I noticed that this deodorant kept me fresh all day without any scent, which turned out to be refreshing. It felt light and didn\u2019t cause any redness or itching, unlike other baking soda-based deodorants that can sometimes be harsh. The only downside is that it can leave some white residue on clothing, especially darker fabrics. To minimize this, I recommend applying a thin layer and allowing it to dry completely before dressing. \u2022 Pros: Long-lasting odor control, gentle on sensitive skin, free from fragrances and essential oils. \u2022 Cons: Those with very sensitive skin might still feel some dryness, so pairing it with a light moisturizer can help. Can leave white marks on dark clothing.  Next up is the Plumping Face Mask*, a product I\u2019d been eager to try for its promise of hydration and glow. Packed with hydrating ingredients like honey and botanicals, this face mask also has a beautiful natural fragrance that\u2019s not overwhelming but definitely adds a nice sensory experience to the routine. The texture is rich and honey-like, perfect for a mask you want to leave on and let your skin absorb fully. After applying a thin layer and leaving it on for about 15 minutes, my skin felt instantly softer and more hydrated! I usually apply masks directly after a sauna session to give my skin an extra boost, and this one fits perfectly into that ritual. The mask also has a subtle, minty cooling sensation on the skin, which I found incredibly refreshing\u2014it adds a nice, invigorating touch, especially when my skin feels tired. While it\u2019s too early to say if it\u2019ll have long-term plumping effects, I could see this being a great addition whenever my skin needs a hydration boost. And it smells amazing! \u2022 Pros: Luxurious texture, instantly hydrates and softens, gives a temporary plumping effect. \u2022 Cons: The amount is also quite small, so it may not last as long if used frequently.  The Plumping Serum* was my final pick from Primally Pure, chosen for its hydrating and skin-smoothing benefits. This serum combines ingredients like hyaluronic acid, squalane, and plant-based oils that are known to retain moisture and smooth out the skin\u2019s texture. The formula is rich without being too heavy, something I look for in products that promise hydration without greasiness. I use this serum after cleansing and toning in my evening routine, applying a few drops and letting it sink. Right away, I noticed my skin feeling plumper and looking smoother. It can also be used in the morning routine and provide a great base for makeup. \u2022 Pros: Heavyweight and hydrating, makes skin feel soft and plump, works well under other products. \u2022 Cons: The scent is earthy and may not be for everyone, though I personally love it. The amount is also on the smaller side, so it feels like a bit of a splurge for the price. These products have shown me why Primally Pure has such a loyal following. With simple ingredients and thoughtful formulations, they\u2019ve made it possible to find truly non-toxic products that don\u2019t compromise on performance. Use the code Orbasics to save 10% on your Primally Pure order!  Primally Pure was founded by Bethany McDaniel, inspired by her personal journey to find truly non-toxic skincare solutions. It all began on her family\u2019s organic farm, where she started crafting simple skincare products free from synthetic additives and artificial fragrances. Bethany\u2019s passion for pure, natural ingredients grew into Primally Pure, a brand built on the belief that skincare should be both effective and uncomplicated. At the heart of Primally Pure\u2019s philosophy is a commitment to using pure, recognizable ingredients. The brand carefully selects high-quality components, often sourced organically, ensuring each product is free from harmful chemicals and\u00a0artificial fragrances, making them a great option for those with skin allergies or sensitivities. Bethany believes in the power of nature to nourish the skin, stating, \u201cNature knows best and has given us everything we need \u2013 no chemicals, fragrances or fillers needed.\u201d Primally Pure offers a simple yet powerful range of skincare and body care products, each thoughtfully crafted to be effective without unnecessary ingredients.Their product line includes: \u2022 Deodorants: Available in various formulations to suit different skin types and sensitivities. \u2022 Skincare: A range encompassing cleansing oils, toning mists, hydrating masks, and serums, each designed to support skin health naturally. \u2022 Wellness Tools: Items such as dry brushes and facial tools that promote holistic self-care practices. Some popular products include the Cleansing Oil, Everything Spray, Plumping Mist, Beauty Cream, and Lemongrass Deodorant.  One of the unique and standout ingredients in several Primally Pure products is emu oil. It\u2019s an ingredient you don\u2019t often see in mainstream skincare, but Primally Pure includes it in products like their beauty cream, plumping mist and body butter for very specific reasons. Emu oil is packed with fatty acids and antioxidants, making it a powerful moisturizer and skin-nourisher. It penetrates deeply, working well even for those with dry or mature skin types that need extra hydration. It also has natural anti-inflammatory properties, which is why it\u2019s known to soothe and calm the skin effectively. For anyone dealing with sensitivity, redness, or even irritation from harsher products, emu oil can be a lifesaver, helping to restore balance and comfort to the skin. Bethany\u2019s approach to product development is deeply rooted in her personal experiences and commitment to clean living. She emphasizes the importance of transparency and integrity in skincare, aiming to provide products that are both safe and effective. As she reflects on her journey, Bethany notes, \u201cWe\u2019re rooted in time-tested, traditional perspectives that honor ancient wisdom and animal-based products to guide you in creating transformative results in your daily life.\u201d For more insights into Bethany\u2019s philosophy and the story behind Primally Pure, you can watch her interview on the Happier & Healthier Podcast: <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jgbdoGDlkfQ?si=mkpy3XW7sNs-sB5O\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe> Primally Pure\u2019s customer service stands out for its warmth, promptness, and genuine support. Each interaction feels like talking to a team that truly cares about customer experience, whether it\u2019s for ingredient advice or product help. They create a sense of community, making customers feel valued and supported. Primally Pure offers free shipping on orders over $75, which I take advantage of by bundling a few items at a time. They also have a great return policy: returns or exchanges are allowed within 60 days, and beyond that, store credit is provided. Their online form makes returns and exchanges quick and hassle-free, allowing you to try products with confidence. Primally Pure is undoubtedly an investment. The price point is on the higher side, and I\u2019ve noticed that the product sizes can feel a bit small compared to other options. But what you\u2019re getting for the price is something special. Primally Pure goes above and beyond in quality, both in terms of ingredients and even packaging. Every product feels thoughtfully crafted and is packed with genuinely effective, high-quality ingredients\u2014no fillers or artificial additives, just real, natural components . It\u2019s clear they prioritize the quality of every single ingredient, which I appreciate, especially in a world where \u201cnatural\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean non-toxic or effective. Their eco-friendly packaging, with minimal plastic and sturdy reusable glass jars or recyclable materials, speaks to their commitment to sustainability and quality. This is a brand that seems to care about the impact of its products, both on your skin and the planet. So, is it worth it? If you\u2019re ready to invest in clean beauty products that deliver real results, then yes, Primally Pure is worth every penny.  \u2022 Trustworthy Quality: Primally Pure has won me over with the quality and thoughtfulness behind each product. Using high-quality, organic ingredients and simple formulas actually live up to the promise of non-toxic skincare, which is rare to find and feels refreshing. \u2022 Effective, Non-Irritating Formulas: In my years of trying various natural skincare, Primally Pure products stand out because they work without any big downsides. Whether it\u2019s a deodorant that actually controls odor or skincare that nourishes without irritation, these natural, non-toxic skincare products products consistently deliver on their claims. \u2022 Mindful Packaging: I\u2019m a huge fan of their eco-conscious packaging\u2014almost no plastic and everything feels high-quality and sustainable. It\u2019s clear that Primally Pure cares about both the environment and their customers\u2019 health. \u2022 Worth the Investment: I won\u2019t lie, the price can be an investment, especially with the sizes being a bit on the smaller side. But knowing that I\u2019m paying for truly effective, clean ingredients makes it worth it. For me, it\u2019s more than just skincare; it\u2019s a commitment to quality that I\u2019m happy to support.  Primally Pure has impressed me with natural, high-quality but simple ingredients. For me, their products have become essentials in my routine, nourishing the skin, especially because they\u2019re effective without being harsh. I feel confident using Primally Pure because they\u2019re committed to natural, non-toxic ingredients. It\u2019s reassuring to know what I\u2019m putting on my skin is simple and safe, especially with sensitive skin. Yes, their deodorants are ones of the best I\u2019ve tried in the natural category for odor control, even if they may leave a little residue on darker clothes. For me, it\u2019s been worth it to finally find a deodorant that works without irritation.

Learn more \u2192 A mattress is more than just my place to rest\u2014it\u2019s where I dream, where I heal, where I start and end my days. It\u2019s where life happens. It\u2019s where I\u2019ve spent countless nights comforting my daughter, desperately snagging naps when I can, and creating a safe, nurturing nest for both of us. In this Naturepedic mattress review, I\u2019ll share how finding the right mattress became part of a journey that started during one of the most pivotal moments of my life: my pregnancy. Plus, I'll share how you can save 15% on your own non-toxic mattress journey.  Image @ Jennifer Jankovitz My journey with non-toxic bedding didn\u2019t start with Naturepedic, but it led me here. During my pregnancy, I knew I needed a healthy environment for my baby, so I pieced together what I could afford at the time. Years later, when I was ready to invest in something that truly aligned with my values, Naturepedic stood out, and ultimately their Serenade Organic Hybrid Mattress* became the bed where I lay my head to rest. In this article, I\u2019ll give you the troves of my research and real-life testing, consolidated into something easy to read, so that your mattress search is much simpler than mine. From the way they engineer adhesive-free certified organic mattresses to their unwavering commitment to organic integrity, Naturepedic quickly stood out as the clear choice for me. And I think after reading this, you\u2019ll see why it might be the right choice for you, too. The Serenade Organic Hybrid Mattress  Image @ Naturepedic Better, cooler, easier sleep... Starting at $1,399 Use code **ORBASICS15** for 15% off Before deciding on this organic mattress, I spent hours researching everything I could about non-toxic mattresses: from learning about VOCs and chemical off-gassing to understanding certifications like GOTS and MADE SAFE. I read countless reviews and watched videos of others who had already slept on Naturepedic mattresses. I wanted to make sure this wasn\u2019t just a healthy choice, but a comfortable one too. As far as the reviewing process, well, this is my bed\u2014part of my nightly routine, my real-life, night-to-night experience, the nest I share with my 2-year-old daughter.  Image @ Jennifer Jankovitz For the past two months, from bedtime stories to middle-of-the-night requests for \u201cwater\u201d and early morning wake-ups, this mattress has been through it all with us. And while most Naturepedic mattress reviews won\u2019t tell you how well a bed stands up to baby acro yoga, I can assure you\u2014this one passed the test! We\u2019ve spent hours lounging, jumping, and unwinding in this space, so what you\u2019re getting is an honest, lived-in review. When I was pregnant with my daughter, I didn\u2019t have much. There were some tough circumstances in the beginning, and I was living with just the basics while doing my best to live a non toxic lifestyle. And there was one thing I knew I had to do before she was born\u2014I needed a non-toxic bed. At the time, I was sleeping on a gifted futon, but it was old and uncomfortable, and I had no idea what it was made of. I wondered if that futon was what was causing a mysterious rash on my legs. I had done all the research. I knew the dangers of traditional bedding, and making sure my bed was safe felt like a priority, not just for me but for my pregnancy and my baby. I imagined us spending countless hours in our \u201cnest,\u201d and I knew it had to be a healthy space. My solution? Two natural latex mattress toppers. It was a way to create a non-toxic bed that fit my budget. Of course, it wasn\u2019t perfect\u2014the toppers didn\u2019t align, they weren\u2019t as thick as a traditional mattress, and the fitted sheet never quite fit. But we made it work. It\u2019s been a couple of years since then, and my life has changed. I\u2019ve been rebuilding, and finances are coming together. Once again, my \u201cnest\u201d feels like a priority, but this time, it\u2019s more than just comfort. This bed now symbolizes my accomplishments\u2014both financially and in terms of self-worth. I know you didn\u2019t really come for this story... but maybe your process of choosing a bed has a deeper meaning too. Don\u2019t big purchases always stir up some emotion? For me, this new bed represents the place in my life I'm in now. The place where I can prioritize my health, where I can say \u201cyes\u201d to a high-end mattress and good quality, organic sheets. And I\u2019m proud of that. After years of just getting by, I'm now creating a safe, comforting space for both myself and my daughter and it feels like I'm finally giving us both what we truly deserve. The Serenade Organic Hybrid Mattress is perfect for: Side sleepers needing pressure relief for hips and shoulders Hot sleepers who need temperature regulation through natural fibers Anyone looking for a healthy, chemical-free sleep environment Use code **ORBASICS15** for 15% off  Image @ Naturepedic Provides balanced support and pressure relief Sleeps cool thanks to organic wool and cotton Made without toxic chemicals, adhesives, or flame retardants Slightly higher price point than conventional mattresses, but worth it for those seeking long-term comfort and health benefits Organic cotton fabric and wool for breathable comfort and temperature regulation Organic latex for pressure relief and support 8\u201d glueless encased coils for motion isolation and body contouring Certified for safety and sustainability, including GOTS, GOLS, MADE SAFE\u00ae, EWG Verified\u00ae, and UL/GREENGUARD Gold Use code **ORBASICS15** for 15% off Finding a mattress that aligns with my health values took time, but Naturepedic stood out for reasons I couldn\u2019t overlook. Let me break down why. When I started looking into Naturepedic, I discovered they\u2019re the only organic mattress brand that avoids using adhesives entirely\u2014it's not in the layers, and it's not in the coils. Many brands claim to be adhesive-free but don\u2019t mention the pounds of glue hiding in the coil system. So, what makes Naturepedic mattresses safe? Naturepedic developed its own technology to heat-seal the coils, making sure their mattresses are free of harmful glues which are known to be a source of toxic ingredients like formaldehyde and VOCs. Not only are these ingredients linked to serious health concerns like respiratory problems, headaches, and even long-term health risks like cancer, but they also contribute to environmental pollution. Knowing that my daughter and I are sleeping on something completely free from harmful adhesives gave me complete peace of mind. This was the ultimate deciding factor for me. No other brand of organic, nontoxic mattress met these standards across their entire line, and that told me Naturepedic wasn\u2019t just offering the best product\u2014they were doing it with integrity. I felt confident that if they were this transparent and meticulous in areas most consumers never even think about, I could trust them to hold that same integrity in every aspect of their business\u2014even in the parts we can\u2019t see.  Image @ Naturepedic Every part of the Serenade mattress is carefully crafted from the highest-quality, certified organic materials: Organic Cotton: A healthier alternative to synthetics, this USDA-certified organic cotton is soft, breathable, and free of harmful chemicals. Organic Wool: Naturally regulates temperature and wicks away moisture while providing fire protection, without chemicals. Organic Latex: Sourced from rubber trees, it offers pressure relief and support without the harmful ingredients found in synthetic blends. PLA Fiber: This plant-based material wicks moisture and adds durability for long-term comfort, derived from non-GMO sugarcane. Glueless Encased Coils: Individually wrapped coils provide full-body support, reduce motion transfer, and promote airflow without adhesives. Naturepedic mattresses come with a range of industry-leading certifications, offering reassurance for health-conscious consumers like you and me. Ensures that all textiles meet the strict standards for organic content, including ethical sourcing. Guarantees the organic nature of latex and ensures environmentally friendly processing. Naturepedic is the first mattress brand to achieve this, meeting strict health and transparency criteria. This certification verifies that Naturepedic products are free from toxic ingredients. Validates low chemical emissions, including formaldehyde-free testing. Ensures that the wood and latex used are sourced sustainably and responsibly. Naturepedic has been redefining sleep since 2003, building a reputation as the go-to brand for organic and non-toxic mattresses. What started as a simple goal\u2014creating a safer mattress for children\u2014has evolved into a full-fledged movement toward healthier sleep for the whole family. For over two decades, Naturepedic has pushed the boundaries of sustainability and transparency, making it a trusted brand for eco-conscious sleepers.  Company Overview Naturepedic's mission centers around offering mattresses that are safe for people and the planet. It\u2019s not just about the materials they avoid\u2014like polyurethane foam and toxic flame retardants\u2014but about the thoughtful choices they make for the environment. When I was searching for a mattress that fit my values, this level of integrity was important to me. I didn\u2019t just want comfort; I wanted a mattress I could trust for my daughter and myself. And Naturepedic\u2019s commitment to both safety and environmental sustainability made them the clear winner for me. Naturepedic\u2019s sustainability efforts touch every part of their business, from reducing carbon emissions to supporting renewable energy and maintaining zero-waste facilities. For me, this isn't just a perk\u2014it's a vital reason I trust the brand. Their \"Caring for the Environment Inside and Out\" program ensures that everything, from raw material sourcing to recyclability, is handled with minimal environmental impact. It\u2019s comforting to know my mattress choice aligns with my values, supporting a healthier planet, even beyond my home. The Sustainability Report highlights Naturepedic's commitment to continuous improvement, transparency, and ethical practices. Knowing they\u2019re not just hitting benchmarks but striving for long-term environmental stewardship solidifies my trust in their integrity. And it's all available right on their website. Naturepedic offers a range of adult mattresses designed to meet various comfort and customization needs. Here's a breakdown of their models: Serenade*: My personal choice! The basic hybrid model, combining latex and coils. It\u2019s available in three firmness options, offering flexibility for sleepers who prefer different levels of support. Concerto Pillow Top*: Similar to the Serenade but with a plush pillow top for added softness. It also comes in two foundation heights: 8\" or 2\", giving more flexibility in mattress height preferences. EOS Collection*: This customizable line allows for five different firmness options on both sides of the bed, making it perfect for couples with differing preferences. The EOS Classic is a hybrid, the EOS Pillowtop mattress adds extra cushion, and the EOS Trilux is an all-latex version. Halcyon Collection*: A luxury collection for those seeking the highest-quality sustainable materials and craftsmanship. With organic cotton, wool, alpaca, and cashmere, this hybrid latex and coil line comes in three profiles\u201410\", 13\", and 16\"\u2014for a truly luxurious sleep experience. Each of these models offers distinct features, allowing you to choose the best one based on your personal comfort and lifestyle needs. The assembly process was incredibly simple and didn\u2019t feel like \"assembly\" at all. The mattress arrived pressure-wrapped and rolled into a large box, so it was just a matter of opening the box, shimmying the wrapped mattress out, and carefully cutting away the plastic. With a little muscle, one person can definitely handle the job.  As soon as the plastic was removed, the mattress began to slowly unfurl and expand on its own\u2014no heavy lifting or complicated setup required.  To handle any initial off-gassing from the new mattress, I placed it in a spare bedroom with the window open. Even at first, the smell was very mild and lacked that harsh chemical odor some mattresses have. After about three days, the smell had completely dissipated, though I left the window open for full five days just to be cautious.  Overall, the process was as easy as it gets\u2014unbox, shimmy, cut, and relax!  Image @ Jennifer Jankovitz This was something I noticed after my very first night. Despite all the tossing and turning (and a toddler\u2019s occasional limb flopping on me), I didn\u2019t wake up sweaty. That\u2019s a huge co-sleeping win. If you know, you know. If you\u2019ve ever done the ever-so-careful slip out of bed to avoid waking your baby, you\u2019ll know how crucial this is. Coming from strictly latex toppers, which excel at this, I was a bit concerned. While the motion transfer is slightly more noticeable, it\u2019s controlled enough that she doesn\u2019t wake when I get out of bed. Bonus: her tosses and turns don\u2019t wake me up either! If this fails in a mattress, your queen size can feel more like a full. And with a toddler in the bed, every inch matters! This is one of the things I love most about the Serenade. I can be savoring those last few inches of space and still feel like I\u2019m in the middle, perfectly supported. As long as I don\u2019t roll to the wrong side! I\u2019ve always been a side sleeper, and in the past, I\u2019d wake up with sore hips or shoulders. But with the cushion-firm option, that discomfort is gone. Whether we\u2019re snuggling before bed or I\u2019m stretching out solo, the pressure relief has been spot on. I initially debated between firm and cushion-firm, but I\u2019m glad I chose the latter. While I sometimes wonder if a firmer bed would suit me, I\u2019ve realized that waking up pain-free means this mattress is working just fine for my body. It\u2019s softer than what I used before, but it\u2019s doing wonders for my hips and shoulders. Sleeping on the Naturepedic mattress feels like getting the best night\u2019s sleep I ever knew I needed. It\u2019s soft, cozy, and somehow still manages to support me perfectly. After long days, I melt into it like a cloud, but one that has my back\u2014literally. I opted for the cushion-firm version, which strikes the perfect balance: soft enough to cradle my sore spots but firm enough to support my hips and shoulders. I\u2019ve noticed a huge difference in how I wake up\u2014no more aches, no more stiffness. And as a side sleeper, the pressure relief has been a game-changer. And parents, you\u2019ll feel me on this: motion transfer is practically nonexistent. I can slip out of bed without waking my daughter, and her nighttime tosses don\u2019t disturb me. It\u2019s a whole new level of restful. Use code **ORBASICS15** for 15% off Yes, Naturepedic mattresses come with a higher price, starting around $1,999 and going up to $5,000+ for more customizable models. But that price reflects their commitment to quality.  Naturepedic uses certified organic natural materials like cotton, latex, and wool\u2014free from toxic chemicals\u2014and manufactures in ways that prioritize sustainability. No harmful foams, no adhesives. Just eco-friendly processes and full transparency. With certifications like GOTS, GOLS, and MADE SAFE\u00ae, Naturepedic guarantees the highest standards for safety and sustainability. You\u2019re not just buying a mattress; you\u2019re investing in a product made responsibly. They offer a 100-night risk-free trial and a 25-year warranty, giving you the security to sleep easy, knowing your investment is protected. When you factor in the premium materials, transparency, sustainability, and customer protections, the price tag starts to make a lot more sense. Ultimately, Naturepedic stood out because of their integrity, transparency, and genuine commitment to creating a non-toxic product. Yes, the price reflects top-quality materials, but more importantly, it reflects a brand that goes above and beyond in its manufacturing practices. Knowing that I can trust Naturepedic to provide a truly safe and incredibly comfortable bed gives me peace of mind. This mattress became more than just a place to sleep\u2014it\u2019s where I can nurture myself and my daughter with confidence. And to me, that's worth every penny.

When I learned that even some popular period underwear could contain PFAS (so-called \u2018forever chemicals\u2019), I was shocked: During my search, I discovered that nearly 65% of period underwear may contain PFAS.  These chemicals are added to some textiles to make them \u201cmoisture-wicking\u201d or \u201cstain-resistant.\u201d Yet they can build up in your body and have been linked to hormone disruption, fertility issues, and even some cancers. A 2020 report found high levels of PFAS in Thinx\u2019s period underwear, raising awareness about toxins in menstrual products. As someone committed to non-toxic lifestyle, I've spent countless hours researching, testing, and personally wearing these period underwear options to create the most comprehensive, science-backed guide available. So I\u2019ve put together this guide on the best non-toxic period underwear that\u2019s free of PFAS and made with safer materials. Plus, I\u2019ll walk you through exactly what to look for when shopping for clean period products and how to avoid sneaky, misleading claims. Let\u2019s dive in!  Non-toxic period underwear aims to avoid using problematic chemicals like PFAS. Many brands rely on natural fibers such as seaweed viscose yarn, bamboo yarn, or organic cotton for solid absorbency without exposing you to worrisome toxins. In practical terms, \u201cPFAS-free\u201d means you\u2019re sidestepping chemicals that can linger in your body and potentially mess with your hormonal balance. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are manmade chemicals often used to give fabrics that \u201cstain-resistant\u201d or \u201cleak-proof\u201d quality. But PFAS don\u2019t just wash out\u2014they can accumulate in your body over time, and research links them to all kinds of reproductive and hormonal issues. As someone who cares about clean living, I definitely don\u2019t want these \u201cforever chemicals\u201d near my most sensitive areas. Here's what experts say about PFAS effects: Bioaccumulation: These long-lasting chemicals build up in your body over time. PFAS can remain in human blood for up to 8 years after exposure, with studies showing that 98% of Americans have detectable levels of PFAS in their bloodstream Immunosuppression: PFAS exposure can affect your immune system. Endocrine disruption: Once PFAS enter your body, these forever chemicals mimic hormones and interfere with their normal functions.\u00a0 Potential carcinogens: PFAS are linked to an increased risk of certain cancers. One especially concerning detail: the vulva is the most absorbent part of your body, according to experts like Alexandra Scranton from Women\u2019s Voices for the Earth. So if your underwear is laced with PFAS, there\u2019s a direct route for those chemicals to travel into your bloodstream and accumulate in your organs. Fortunately, more and more brands are stepping up with comfy, toxin-free period underwear. Below, I\u2019ll show you how they work and which ones are the safest. Period underwear has multiple layers: a moisture-wicking top layer (often cotton or bamboo) to keep you dry, and absorbent inner layers (using materials like microfiber or polyester) to lock in fluid. Importantly, non-toxic brands avoid harmful coatings \u2013 being polyester blend does not automatically mean PFAS, as PFAS are special treatments that some brands now eliminate . \u201cBest\u201d Lilova | Shop Here* Boody Period | Shop Here* Goat Union | Shop Here* The Period Company | Shop Here* Saalt | Shop Here* TomboyX | Shop Here* \u201cBetter\u201d Lola | Shop Here* Innersy | Shop Here* Poppins Period | Shop Here* Diva | Shop Here* Flowette | Shop Here* We divided our top picks into two categories: \"Best\" Non-Toxic Period Underwear: These are the purest and safest options. They lean on organic fabrics, hold robust safety certifications like GOTS or OEKO-TEX, and undergo independent lab testing confirming no detectable PFAS. For instance, Lilova states each batch is tested twice. Goat Union publicly shares their lab results, and The Period Company is UL PFAS-FREE certified.  \"Better\" Non-Toxic Period Underwear: These are also PFAS-free, but might not use certified organic fabrics, so there\u2019s a possibility of pesticide residue. They\u2019re still significantly safer than mainstream underwear treated with forever chemicals. Ready to find toxin-free period underwear that fits your needs? Let\u2019s check out our top non-toxic picks.. Best for: Fashionable Designs Pricing: $34 Certifications: N/A, external laboratories PFAS tests Materials: GOTS-certified Organic Cotton, TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane), Nylon, and Elastane. Size Range: XS - 3XL Why We Like It: If you\u2019re craving a high-waist style that genuinely handles heavy flow, you\u2019ll want to hear about Lilova. I\u2019ve found that it combines comfortable coverage with powerful absorbency\u2014up to 4\u20135 tampons\u2019 worth\u2014while still feeling surprisingly soft. In my experience, heavier absorbency can feel a bit thicker, but I\u2019ll take that small trade-off over changing pads multiple times. Lab tests have shown no detectable PFAS in Lilova\u2019s underwear. If you\u2019ve been on the fence about non-toxic credentials, Lilova delivers. They also use organic cotton against your skin, which many of us appreciate for that softer, safer feel. So iff heavy-flow nights stress you out, Lilova\u2019s High-Waist can ease that burden.

Boody\u2019s full brief is one of the best reusable period underwear I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019ve slept so peacefully in Boody\u2019s high-rise briefs. Made from bamboo viscose and cotton, this non toxic period underwear is insanely comfortable and absorbent. They fit snugly but never feel tight on my belly, even on heavy-flow nights. They\u2019re tested for PFAS (none detected!) and follow OEKO-TEX guidelines for dyes, which is a big relief if you worry about hidden chemicals. Trust me, once you try them overnight, it\u2019ll be hard to go back to your old pads. Boody also leads on the health front \u2013 it\u2019s one of the first brands to obtain third-party PFAS-free certification, so you can trust there are no hidden chemicals. They also use OEKO-TEX-approved dyes and processes, ensuring a safer garment overall.  So if you want a luxuriously soft experience that also keeps you dry on heavier days, Boody is a top contender. It\u2019s a true blend of cozy, safe, and leakproof.

Their boxer briefs provide full protection for moderate flow\u2014They feel invisible under high-waisted jeans and handle moderate flow with ease\u2014no dreaded \u201cdiaper\u201d . They work great under high-waisted jeans, staying invisible while keeping you protected.  I love that Goat Union publicly shares PFAS test results, which makes them super transparent compared to some big-name brands. Goat is comfy, inclusive, and they show you the receipts for being PFAS-free. Shop Goat Union here*  Best Affordable  Pricing: $12.00 Certifications: OEKO-TEX\u00ae STANDARD 100, Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), UL PFAS-FREE certified Materials: Certified Organic Cotton, Spandex Jersey, Polyester, Polyester PUL Size Range: XS - 6X Why We Like It: The Period Company is known for affordability and a softer, more casual look. If you\u2019re on a budget but still want something you can trust, you might find your match here. I love that their bikini cut is basically soft cotton with a slightly relaxed fit. It can feel like wearing normal underwear\u2014no fancy lace, just pure functionality. Some folks say it runs a little larger, so if you like snug, you might size down. The brand focuses on organic cotton, and they\u2019ve tested PFAS-free (Intertek/UL certified). Considering the low price, I\u2019m impressed by how reliable they are, and they\u2019re often recommended as a \u201cfirst pair\u201d of period panties. If you need budget-friendly, all-cotton comfort with heavy-flow capacity, The Period Company shines. Don\u2019t expect super sleek styling, but you\u2019ll love that secure and soft feel. Shop The Period Company here*  Best for: Thong Pricing: $29.00 Certifications: B Corp, Plastic Negative Materials: Nylon, Spandex, and Cotton. Size Range: XS - XL Why We Like It: Saalt is a favorite for anyone wanting sleek, barely-there period underwear. It\u2019s basically \u201cperiod undies that don\u2019t look or feel like period undies,\u201d if you know what I mean. I\u2019m personally a huge fan of their Seamless a PFAS-free Thong, non-toxic, eco-friendly alternative to traditional panty liners,\u2014it\u2019s so thin and smooth that you can wear leggings or a body-hugging dress without a trace. The thong absorbs about 1\u20132 tampons\u2019 worth, ideal for spotting or light days. You can use it to absorb everyday vaginal discharge, light menstrual flow, spotting, and even sweat.  Despite being light and crazy thin, Saalt\u2019s gusset is quick-drying and rarely leaks. On heavier flows, many use their brief or hipster versions, which handle up to 3\u20134 tampons. If you want minimal bulk yet great coverage, Saalt nails it. Saalt is OEKO-TEX certified and openly declares no PFAS in their fabrics. They also released third-party testingconfirming no PFAS in their updated collections, so it\u2019s a reliable brand if you want peace of mind. The brand also donates part of its proceeds, so they\u2019re a do-good company, too. If slim, discreet underwear is your priority\u2014especially on light or moderate days\u2014Saalt offers the perfect blend of style, safety, and performance. Shop Saalt here*  Best for: Gender-inclusive Options Pricing: $30.20 - $42.70 Certifications: B Corp Materials: OEKO-TEX Certified Cotton, Spandex, and Polyester. Size Range: 3XS to 6X Why We Like It: I see TomboyX as a haven for those seeking boxer briefs or gender-inclusive designs that don\u2019t look overly feminine. It\u00b4s a go-to for inclusive sizing and gender-neutral designs. TomboyX is known for how well their boxer briefs, boyshorts, and trunks fit across all body shapes. What I love most about their period underwear\u2014and what many customers praise too\u2014is how comfortable it feels. Their period underwear can handle up to 6\u20138 tampons\u2019 worth\u2014serious capacity! That\u2019s why many trust it for heavy days or overnight. Additionally, TomboyX menstrual panties tested free of PFOS and PFOA chemicals in a 2020 third-party analysis, so you can shop with confidence. I think they\u2019re especially great if you prefer a more androgynous look. So if you crave a boxer style that\u2019s size-inclusive and leakproof for heavier flows, TomboyX can give you that effortless, comfy coverage you\u2019ve been looking for\u2014without any toxic chemicals. Shop TomboyX here*  Best for: Bikini Pricing: $24.99 Certifications: OEKO-TEX\u00ae STANDARD 100 Materials: Cotton, Lycra, Polyester, and Polyamide. Size Range: XS - 3XL Why We Like It: LOLA made its name with organic tampons and pads, but their period underwear deserves attention, too. I love the way it feels like regular, lightweight cotton undies. You get an ultra-soft cotton that wicks away moisture and keeps you surprisingly dry. The fit is typically a classic bikini that feels snug without pinching. If you\u2019d prefer something that isn\u2019t bulky or stiff, LOLA could be your go-to. Though designed for moderate flow (3-ish tampons), I can confirm that they rarely leak. For a comfy, no-fuss cotton bikini that\u2019s discreet and handles moderate flows, LOLA is a sweet choice. It\u2019s mostly organic, non-toxic, and widely available\u2014an all-around crowd-pleaser. Why Better? While these are still PFAS-free, they may not use 100% organic fabrics or hold as many safety certifications. However, they remain safer alternatives to mainstream PFAS-treated underwear. Shop Lola here*  Best for: Postpartum Pricing: $24.99 Certifications: OEKO-TEX\u00ae STANDARD 100 Materials: Cotton, Polyurethane Laminate (PUL), and Spandex. Size Range: XS - 5XL Why We Like It: I wish I had these back when I gave birth\u2014I remember how stressful postpartum leaks can be. So if you\u2019re in your late pregnancy, these non-toxic period panties are a must-have. Innersy helps you manage light incontinence, so you can focus on your little one's arrival instead of worrying about unexpected leaks. And they\u2019re free of PFAS (though they don\u2019t detail how they test). If you want a gentle, high-waisted option that supports postpartum healing or just provides extra tummy comfort, INNERSY can be a lifesaver. They might not hold the biggest flows alone, but they keep most moderate leaks locked in. Why Better: The brand claims that its products are PFAS-free, though it doesn\u2019t offer details on third-party testing, aside from its OEKO-TEX certification. Shop Innersy here*  Best for: Absorbency Pricing: $24.00 Certifications: OEKO-TEX\u00ae STANDARD 100 Materials: Cotton/modal blend fabric. Size Range: XS - 3X Why We Like It: If you have a moderate to heavy flow, Poppins Period could be just what you need. This highly-absorbent period underwear is a fantastic option to keep you leak-free throughout your period. Depending on the day, it can serve as your main protection or as a backup alongside a menstrual cup, reusable pads, or non-toxic tampons. Why Better? Poppins Period claims its menstrual products are PFAS-free, but the brand only references its OEKO-TEX certification as proof.\u00a0 Shop Poppins Period here*  Best for: Odor Fighting Pricing: $30.00 Certifications: B Corp Materials: Polyester, Rayon, Recycled Nylon, and Elastane. Size Range: XS - 4XL Why We Like It: Diva, famous for its DivaCup, also launched reusable period underwear that feels like normal panties but packs serious absorbency. Diva\u2019s non-toxic period underwear stands out with its innovative zinc-infused gusset. This addition offers antimicrobial and antibacterial properties, helping to reduce the risk of infections and unpleasant odors. In my experience, they\u2019re so light you forget they\u2019re period panties. If you dislike thick gussets, you\u2019ll appreciate Diva\u2019s \u201cquick dry\u201d technology. You\u2019ll also love how quickly it absorbs menstrual fluids, keeping you fresh and protected all day.\u00a0 Why Better? They say they don\u2019t \u201cadd\u201d PFAS, but haven\u2019t explicitly proven PFAS-free. If you want a brand known for its menstrual cups and supportive products, Diva might appeal to you, though I\u2019d love to see them do more thorough testing. Shop Diva here*  Best for: Teens Pricing: $18.20 Certifications: N/A Materials: 95% Cotton and 5% Spandex Size Range: XXS teen - 6XL Why We Like It: Looking for teen-friendly period underwear? Flowette focuses on youth sizing and style to help younger folks feel comfy and confident\u2014often for the first time. The stylish period underwear is the perfect option to help teens feel comfortable during their period. They have bright, fun patterns, plus the sizing is super inclusive. Even though it\u2019s teen-oriented, Flowette can hold up to 40 ml\u2014around 4\u20135 tampons\u2014enough for many full school days. Some versions go up to 60 ml if your teen\u2019s flow is on the heavier side. If you want your teen to feel secure and comfortable, Flowette does a stellar job. They\u2019re size-inclusive, truly absorbent, and a real confidence boost for younger users or anyone who likes a smaller cut. Why Better? Because they claim PFAS-free but don\u2019t present any certifications, I\u2019d call this a \u201cBetter\u201d choice. That said, it\u2019s still a more reassuring option for a young person than big-brand underwear with no transparency at all Shop Flowette here*  With so many PFAS-free and non-toxic period underwear brands on the market, it can be confusing to pick just one. I\u2019ve found each of these 11 options has its own specialty: Lilova or The Period Company for serious overnight absorbency. Boody or LOLAs if you love ultra-soft, organic-based comfort. Goat Union, TomboyX, or Saalt if you want brand transparency and a range of styles (boxers, thong, etc.). Poppins Period for all-day heavy-flow wear with minimal changes. Diva if you\u2019re already loyal to DivaCup\u2019s reliability. Flowette if you\u2019re looking for teen-friendly sizing. INNERSY if you want budget-friendly, high-waisted postpartum or everyday comfort. Regardless of which brand you choose, know that all these options focus on safer materials, user comfort, and actual performance. Ultimately, you\u2019re the expert on your own flow, lifestyle, and style preferences. My biggest tip is: start with a pair that speaks to your main priority (heavy flow, invisibility, or cost), see how it fits your routine, and build from there. Curious why non-toxic period underwear is worth the switch? Let\u2019s break it down Making the switch to non-toxic period underwear can provide: Reduced Risk of Irritation & Allergies: Conventional period products contain harmful materials that might irritate your sensitive skin, trigger allergies, or cause textile dermatitis. Fewer Vaginal Infections: Board-certified OB-GYN Alyssa Dweck explains that synthetic fabrics can trap moisture, potentially leading to yeast infections. Reduced Exposure to PFAS: Polyfluoroalkyl substances can lead to fertility issues, period irregularities, liver damage, high cholesterol, and even breast cancer.  But here\u2019s the catch: not all brands labeled \u201cnon-toxic\u201d genuinely are. That\u2019s why being an informed shopper is so essential. Imagine my surprise when I found out how loosely regulated period products are. It\u2019s not mandatory for companies to disclose all ingredients. Some other brands even claim they\u2019re \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cgreen,\u201d but behind the scenes, they\u2019re using chemicals like PFAS. Thinx is a prime example: it marketed itself as clean and revolutionary, but a 2020 report revealed high PFAS levels in its underwear. Clearly, it pays to ask tough questions and do a little extra research, because your body deserves nothing less. To ensure your period underwear is truly non-toxic, keep these tips in mind: Materials & Certifications: Prioritize period underwear made primarily from natural fibers or non toxic fabrics, such as organic cotton. Look for GOTS-certified organic cotton or OEKO-TEX\u00ae Standard 100 certification, which means the fabric was tested for harmful substances . These ensure your undies are free from pesticides, formaldehyde, and other toxins. Third Party PFAS Testing: There are around 15,000 PFAS, but most certifications only test a few. Only buy from brands that clearly state they are PFAS-free. Some brands provide third-party test results \u2013 for instance, Goat Union publicly shares its lab test reports confirming zero PFAS . Transparency is a good sign. Absorbency & Layers: Check how much each pair holds (e.g., \u201cholds 3 tampons worth\u201d). Multi-layer designs without toxic coatings can still be very absorbent. Ensure the brand specifies being PFAS-free despite high absorbency. For a quick check, see if brands publish PFAS test results. If they\u2019re transparent\u2014like Lilova or The Period Company\u2014you\u2019re more likely getting truly non-toxic period underwear. If not, be cautious.  When choosing period underwear, prioritize products made with natural, breathable materials that explicitly state they are PFAS-free. While period underwear can be a safe and sustainable menstrual product option, the specific materials, proper hygiene practices, and transparency from manufacturers all play important roles in ensuring both safety and comfort. PFAS Exposure: Most period panties contain PFAS. These forever chemicals can accumulate in your body, increasing the risk of scary health issues like infertility and cancer. Sensitive Area: Your vulva is the most absorbent part of your body. If your period underwear contains PFAS, they will make their way to your bloodstream and organs faster. Greenwashing: Many period underwear brands claim to be \"non-toxic\" and \"PFAS-free,\" without providing evidence to back up this claim. Always opt for brands that provide independent lab testing or trusted safety certifications. Period underwear can be a safe and sustainable alternative to traditional sanitary products when made with appropriate materials like organic cotton, seaweed viscose yarn, bamboo yar, etc.\u00a0However, there are concerns about some period products containing PFAS, which are potentially harmful chemicals.\u00a0The safety of period underwear largely depends on the specific materials used and manufacturing processes employed, with many companies now prioritizing non-toxic options. Looking for explicit \"PFAS-free\" labeling on products or contacting manufacturers directly to inquire about their use of PFAS in their products is a practical approach. Professional testing for PFAS requires specialized laboratory equipment like liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, which isn't accessible to most consumers.\u00a0Products marketed as water-resistant, stain-resistant, or \"leak-proof\" without specifying PFAS-free status might contain these chemicals. Look for third-party certifications, such as GOTS, USDA Organic, or OEKO-TEX Standard. According to research, bacterial growth on underwear products can result in health issues including yeast infections, rashes, and other discomforts. Wearing breathable cotton underwear is recommended to help prevent yeast infections, suggesting that period underwear made with breathable, moisture-wicking materials would be helpful.\u00a0 Cristina Solis is a passionate environmental engineer and sustainability consultant who enjoys educating conscious consumers and helping businesses make a positive impact on our planet.

What if I told you that your favorite products might be secretly damaging your hair? Studies show that hair products are the third most common personal care items linked to cancer cases class (8.3%). Many commercial brands pack their formulas with hidden toxins - like sulfates, parabens and phthalates - that can lead to hair thinning, scalp irritation, hormonal imbalances, and even increased cancer risk! This article will help inform you on the harmful ingredients to avoid in hair products, how to decode misleading labels and how to identify safer, non-toxic alternatives for healthier hair. Think of it as your personal crash course in non-toxic living , allowing you to make kinder choices for your hair and your overall well-being. Your hair care routine may be doing you more harm than good - not just to your hair, but to your entire body. Products you apply don't just coat your hair - they penetrate and absorb into your scalp, one of the most permeable parts of your body. That means chemicals in your products can enter your bloodstream within minutes! I've personally experienced significant hair loss from certain products and extreme dullness/dryness from others. The fewer ingredients I cannot pronounce the better. And when it comes to shampoos - less lather = less damage Whilst evaluating your hair care products, it's important to remember that harmful chemicals are not limited to personal care products. Check our article on 5 toxic home products we use everyday to stay informed on how else you can remove toxic products from your daily routine! Scalp and skin irritation (allergic dermatitis and itchiness) Increased hair breakage, hair loss and frizz Dryness or excessive oil production The long-term consequences of toxic hair products however, can be more alarming. Studies have demonstrated that with prolonged exposure to certain ingredients in hair care can increase the risk of serious health issues like: Hormone disruption: Chemicals like parabens and pthalates mimic estrogen, and can interfere with hormone regulation. Studies have linked both to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders and fertility issues in men and women. A lot of our cosmetic and hair products contain chemicals that mess with our hormones, that's why its important we know how to avoid endocrine disruptors Increased cancer risk - Hair product chemicals have been linked to higher rates of uterine, breast and lung cancers. Chronic illnesses & Organ damage: Hair product chemicals have also been linked to other chronic illnesses like diabetes and even lupus It's not just your body that pays the price - the planet does too. Everytime you wash your hair toxic chemicals like parabens and pthalates flow down the drain, contaminating water supplies, harming marine life and polluting the soil where our food grows. Many of these ingredients do not break down naturally, and accumulate overtime, disrupting ecosystems and threatening biodiversity! If your favourite shampoo lathers into a foamy cleanse, sulfates - specifically sodium laurel sulphate (SLS) and sodium laureate sulphate (SLEs) are likely responsible. These harsh detergents break down dirt and oil but strip your scalp's natural moisture, leaving it dry, unbalanced and irritated. Oil overproduction - When your scalp loses too much moisture, it compensates by producing more oil, leading to greasy roots and dry ends - trapping you in an endless washing cycle Color fading & frizz - Sulfates lift the hair cuticle, causing dyed hair to fade faster, making it more prone to frizz, dehydration, and breakage - espeically if you have curls and textured hair! Scalp irritation - If you have sensitive skin or skin conditions like eczema, surfactants like sulfates can be particularly harsh, and can often exacerbating existing issues How to spot them - Keep an eye out for any ingredient ending in 'sulfate' e.g. ammonium laurel sulfate! Parabens may seem harmless but they wreak havoc on your hormones. Added to products to extend shelf life, preventing bacteria and mold, these, these preservatives mimic oestrogen, interfering with your endocrine system, and potentially increasing risk of reproductive issues and even breast cancer! Why to avoid them Absorption in the body - Alarmingly, parabens have been detected in the urine, blood, and even breast tissue, raising concerns about long-term accumulation How to spot them: check ingredient lists for anything ending in '-paraben' like methyl-, propyl-,butyl- and ethyl-paraben Ever notices how some hair and cosmetic products retain that scent that lingers for hours? This is likely phthalates - a group of chemicals that stabilise fragrance, making scents more potent and long-lasting. Unfortunately, much like ingredients to avoid in makeup and skincare, phthalates are often hidden under vague terms like 'fragrance' or 'parfum' making them tricky to spot on labels. You may be wondering why is fragrance bad?.. what seems like a simple scent blend is actually a mix of hundreds of undisclosed chemicals - thanks to the 'trade secret' loophole that cosmetic companies often rely on to avoid revealing all their secrets! Why to avoid them Scalp sensitivity - phthalates, along with generic fragrance can easily irritate the scalp causing redness, itching and hair loss Health risks - studies have demonstrated that long term exposure to pthalates can be linked to various health issues like, increased risk of asthma, developmental delays and decreased sperm count in men If you've ever had a keratin treatment, you have likely encountered formaldehyde - a well-known carcinogen, used in hair products to keep your hair fizz-free and straight! While you may not always see formaldehyde listed directly, many products contain formaldehyde-releasing agents which release formaldehyde over time. On product labels you may see them listed as DMDM hydantoin, imidazolidinyl urea, or quarternium-15 Why to avoid them: Weakened hair structure - while formaldehyde is used to straighten hair, it can also compromise the natural hair structure and health, causing it to look lifeless and fragile Carcinogenic risk - Identified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), formaldehyde has been linked to increased cancer risk like leukaemia with prolonged exposure Silicones are commonly added to hair products to give the illusion of glossy, frizz-free hair, creating a smooth, shiny finish. While this can initially leave your hair feeling silky soft, silicones are notorious for causing build-up, dullness and long-term damage to your hair. Why to avoid them: Chemical build up- Silicones form a waterproof barrier over the hair shaft, smoothing the cuticle and trapping moisture. However they don't wash out easily and can build up on your hair, making it heavier and harder to maintain How to spot them: Avoid any ingredients ending in \"-cone\", \"-conol\", or \"-siloxane\" (e.g. dimethicone, cyclopentasiloxane), as these are silicone-based products Diethanolamine (DEA), triethalonamine (TEA) and monoethanolamine (MEA) are chemicals that make your shampoo foam, and your conditioner ultra-smooth and creamy! They are used to improve lather, enhance texture and balance the pH of shampoos and conditioners! But they can be found it most hair styling product like mousses, gels and hairsprays. Why to avoid them Carcinogenic risk - DEA, TEA and MEA can sometimes interact with other ingredients in products forming nitrosamines - a class of chemicals that are cancer causing - known to cause liver cancer in rats How to spot them: So if you see 'cocamide DEA, lauramide DEA, or TEA-lauryl sulfate' that's a red flag, steer clear from these when you see them on labels! PEGS give that rich and creamy texture in your conditioner and styling cream, giving hair products that luxurious feel. However, PEGs are derived from petroleum, and during the manufacturing process, they can leave bound harmful toxic contaminants including; Ethylene oxide - a known carcinogen and irritant linked to respiratory issues, brain and nervous system damage 1,4-dioxane- classified as a probable human carcinogen by the EPA - as this is a contaminant this is never added as an ingredient Why to avoid them: Disrupt the scalp's natural barrier - PEGs function as penetration enhancers, which makes the scalp more permeable to other potentially harmful chemicals! How to spot them: They are listed on labels as 'PEG-40, PEG-100 or PEG-based emulsifiers' - the higher the number, the more processed the compound! Triclosan is specifically added to hair products to kill bacteria and prevent contamination. However, despite its intended purpose, it risks to human health has led to its ban in hand soaps by the FDA! However, it can still be found in some anti-dandruff shampoos and medicated scalp treatments. Why to avoid them: Antibiotic resistance & superbugs - Studies have even linked triclosan use to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, also known as 'super bugs'! How to spot them: Check labels for triclosan (TCS) or triclocarban as these are its most common forms Hair dyes can be fun to experiment with, but did you know some dyes may contain harmful heavy metals like lead, mercury, and arsenic? Despite lead acetate being banned in gradual hair darkening products in 2018, these metals can still be found in international hair dye formulas! Although they are often present in trace amounts, they can still be absorbed through the scalp and accumulate in the body, posing serious long-term health risks. Why to avoid them Neurological impact: A review published in Environmental Sciences Europe states \"Toxic elements such as lead, mercury etc can exert toxic effects on humans at relatively low levels... and can have a profound impact on neurocognitive function, particularly in adults\" Pro tip: Look for brands that conduct heavy metal testing on their dyes! Choosing hair care products can be overwhelming, don't let brands overload you with marketing terms - greenwashing is real - don't be fooled! That's why understanding clean beauty certifications is key to making safer and healthier choices. Look for trusted certifications - Green Label, USDA Organic, EWG verified, COSMOS Organic - These certifications ensure products meet strict safety standards and use high percentages of natural or organic ingredients Avoid misleading terms like \"natural\" or \"organic\" - These terms aren't regulated, so products with these labels can still contain harmful synthetic chemicals Check the first five ingredients - these make up the bulk of the product - if you see mineral oil or synthetic fragrance, keep searching - trust me! Use apps to make it easier - Think Dirty, Detox Me and Yuka are my top skincare ingredient checker apps, allowing you to scan barcodes and get the safety rating of the product before you buy! Go sulfate-free & paraben free - Look for products that use coconut-derived surfactants or amino-acid base cleansers that cleanse without stripping moisture. Choose natural preservatives like Vitamin E and rosemary extract Co-washing - If you have dry or curly hair, try cleansing with a conditioner (without mineral oils and silicones). It's gentler on your hair! Silicone-free alternatives - Swap silicones for natural oils like argan, jojoba, or coconut oil for natural shine and hydration. Aloe vera is great too - it smooths hair without coating it Fragrance and phathlate-free alternatives - ditch synthetic fragrance and go for products that use essential oils instead for natural scents DIY alternatives - you can naturally nourish your hair using: Coconut oil which is deeply moisturising and adds shine Apple cider vinegar rinse can help balance scalp pH and add shine (just dilute with water) Switch to clean beauty brands that offer toxin-free hair care, some of my favourites include Ethique* (eco-friendly and natural shampoo bars), Acure* (free from parabens, sulfates and pthalates) and Rahua* (plant-based styling products). You should also consider making the switch to non-toxic dry shampoos brands as these swaps can be easy too. Start small: Swap one product at a time - replace one product at a time, I recommend starting with your most-used ones, like shampoo and conditioners Expect a 'Detox' period: Let your hair adjust (for 2-4 weeks), your hair may initially feel greasy at first until it adjusts. Without synthetic coatings, it may feel different in general, but over time it will feel softer and healthier Support your hair through the transition: Avoid overwashing - washing too much strips your scalp of natural oils. The less you wash, the quicker the transition Brush regularly to encourage distribution of natural scalp oils to the tips of your hair to keep it healthier and shiny Use a clarifying rinse (like apple cider vinegar) to remove product build when needed Hair care products can contain harsh chemicals that dry, irritate, and even harm the scalp. Long-term exposure to things like parabens, phthalates, and formaldehyde-releasing agents has been linked to hormone disruption, cancer risks, and chronic health issues. Toxic ingredients also flow down our drains, damaging ecosystems. Look out for red flags like sulfates, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, silicones, DEA/TEA/MEA, PEGs, triclosan, and heavy metals. Read labels like a pro, trust reputable certifications, and explore cleaner brands. Switch gradually, embrace co-washing if suitable, consider DIY options, and keep an open mind during the \u201cdetox\u201d phase. Look for certifications like EWG Verified or USDA Organic. Avoid sulfates, parabens, and synthetic fragrances. Use apps like Think Dirty to scan ingredients Avoid silicones (dimethicone), parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances to prevent buildup, irritation, and hormone disruption Skip silicones, synthetic fragrances, and drying alcohols (isopropyl alcohol) to avoid buildup and irritation SLS, parabens, synthetic fragrances, and formaldehyde-releasers top the list of toxins Millie Chamberlain is a passionate medical writer based in London.

Although candles are a staple in most homes, traditional paraffin candles which comprise most store-bought candles release pollutants like benzene and toluene (known carcinogens). In fact, studies show that burning paraffin candles contributes to indoor air pollution levels that exceed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards. So, if you're trying to create a healthier home, embracing non-toxic living should you ditch candles? Not necessarily! The good news is that natural wax alternatives like soy and beeswax candles offer a much cleaner and safer way to enjoy candles! The big debate? Soy vs beeswax candles. Both are eco-friendly, and non-toxic, but which one truly stands out in terms of sustainability, health benefits, and performance? In this article, we will weigh up the differences between soy and beeswax candles, covering everything- from burn time to superior scent - so you can decide which is a better option for your home!   Beeswax burns the cleanest with virtually no soot, while soy is still cleaner than paraffin but may release trace pollutants. Beeswax candles have the longest burn time of any natural wax, lasting significantly longer than soy candles. Soy candles hold and release fragrance better, making them ideal for scented options, while beeswax offers a natural honey aroma. Soy candles are more budget-friendly ($10-$30), while beeswax commands a higher price ($15-$70) due to limited availability. Beeswax may have air-purifying properties by releasing negative ions, while soy is better than paraffin but not as clean. Both can be made with cotton or wood wicks, which are safer than metal-core wicks that may release heavy metals when burned. \u00a0 Soy wax - also known as hydrogenated soybean oil - is a renewable and biodegradable natural wax that's commonly used as an alternative to paraffin wax. However, not all soy candles are as 'natural' as they seem. Soy wax is inherently paraffin-free, but some brands mix soy wax with paraffin to cut costs or alter texture, while others add synthetic fragrance and dyes introducing unwanted chemicals like phthalates (which have been linked to hormone disruption), which are common in scented candles! For guaranteed purity: Look for 100% soy wax certifications (e.g., USDA BioPreferred), Avoid terms like 'soy blend' or 'natural wax blend' unless paraffin-free status is confirmed Avoid hidden additives like synthetic fragrance - instead opt for soy infused with essential oils or fragrance oils rather than Prioritize brands that disclose wax composition testing\" Did you know that 90% of soy production comes from genetically modified (GM) crops, which significantly contributes to deforestation and are heavily treated with pesticides? So, if sustainability is important to you - choose non-GMO and organic soy wax, as it's a more ethical, healthier and environmentally responsible option! Our favorite brands for non toxic soy wax candles: Slow North*\u00a0 P.F. Candle Co.*  Beeswax is a natural wax made by honeybees, requiring minimal processing - which makes it one of the purest and most eco-friendly wax options! Unlike soy candles, pure beeswax candles have a naturally sweet, honey-like aroma, meaning they don't need added fragrances. However, if you prefer scented candles, look for beeswax candles blended with organic essential oils! Not all beeswax candles are created equal - here are some things to note:  Some brands bleach or add additives to their beeswax, that can introduce unwanted toxins. Stick to unbleached, 100% pure beeswax for the cleanest burn! Over-harvesting beeswax can negatively impact bee populations. Choose ethically sourced beeswax to support ethical beekeeping and pollination efforts! Our favorite brands for beeswax candles: Happy Organics* Primally Pure Candles* (beeswax mixed with coconut wax) Living Good Candle Co.* Bluecorn* ARCTIC WICKS*  Soy candles burn cleaner that paraffin wax, producing minimal soot. However, some studies suggest that even 100% soy wax can still release trace amounts pollutants like acrolein and formaldehyde, especially when mixed with synthetic fragrance oils. These chemicals have been linked to the following health risks like eye and respiratory irritation, headaches and dizziness, and increased risk of certain cancers. For the cleanest burn, go for 100% soy wax candles infused with essential or phthalate-free fragrance oils Beeswax candles emit little to no soot and harmful pollutants, and therefore widely considered to be the safest candle option. They're also often even praised for their potential air-purifying properties- some believe that they release negative ions, which bind to airborne toxins and allergens, helping to remove them from the air. However, this claim isn't well supported by scientific research! However, beeswax still offers proven benefits: Near-zero soot production (vs. soy's trace emissions) Natural hypoallergenic properties No synthetic fragrance requirements That said, beeswax candles is completely natural and hypoallergenic - making it an excellent choice for people with allergies or respiratory sensitivities!  Surprisingly, it's not just the wax that determines how cleanly a candle burns - the wick matters too! Soy candles - some cheaper candles - especially paraffin-based or soy blends - use metal-core wicks, which can release heavy metals like lead into the air! Although banned in the US in 2003, imported and older candles may still contain them. Beeswax candles - typically use cotton or wood wicks, making them a safer choice, with no risk of heavy metal emissions. Opt for cotton or wood wicks when purchasing candles to avoid potential exposure to heavy metals. If you're looking for a longer-lasting candle, beeswax is the clear winner!  Soy candles burns slower than paraffin wax, but faster than beeswax. They have a lower melting point meaning they provide a longer scent throw, and are an easy swap you're looking for easy replacement for your paraffin candle! Beeswax candles have the longest burn time of any wax and have the slowest burning rate compared to soy and paraffin wax, making it the best choice for longevity!  Scent throw (how well a candle spreads its fragrance) depends on the type of wax and the scent source! Soy candles have a lower melting point, which allows them to hold and release fragrance more effectively. Being a natural unscented candle, they work well with essential or fragrance oils, providing a consistent and natural aroma that can be considered superior to beeswax! Beeswax candles have a natural honey aroma but are less effective at holding scents added scents. If you prefer a stronger fragrance, soy is the better choice. For those with sensitivities, always prefer unscented candles or beeswax. Soy candles are the more affordable compared to beeswax due to lower production costs, typically ranging between $10- $30. Beeswax candles are often pricier, costing between $15-$70 due to limited availability and labor-intensive harvesting. However, their longer burn time and eco-friendliness helps to justify the higher price!   There is no one-size-fits-all answer - it depends on what matters most to you! Choose soy candles if you want a budget-friendly, long-lasting scented candle with great fragrance throw. Just make sure it\u2019s 100% soy wax with essential oils or fragrance oils. However, some of the downsides to consider with soy candles include; May contain additives like synthetic fragrance or GMOs Shorter burn time than beeswax Choose beeswax candles if you want the cleanest-burning, longest-lasting, and most natural wax option. Look for 100% pure, unbleached, and sustainably sourced beeswax. However, some of the downsides to consider with beeswax candles include; Limited scent options Overall more expensive Sustainability concerns if not ethically sourced Both beeswax and soy candles have their limitations, but overall both are great additions to a non-toxic home! For vetted options, see our guide to non-toxic candles which contains inclusion of our top 13 non-toxic candle brands!  Beeswax burns the cleanest & longest! If you're looking for the purest, longest-lasting candle with virtually no soot, beeswax is your best option - just make sure it's 100% pure & sustainably sourced! Soy candles are a great budget-friendly, scented option! They burn cleaner than paraffin, hold fragrance better than beeswax, and are more affordable\u2014but watch out for additives & GMOs! Want better air quality? Go beeswax! Some claim beeswax candles purify the air by releasing negative ions (however, this is not confirmed by research) while soy candles still release trace pollutants, especially if mixed with synthetic fragrances. Wick matters! Avoid metal-core wicks, which can release heavy metals into the air. Stick with cotton or wood wicks for a cleaner burn! Both soy and beeswax candles are eco-friendly! - Non-GMO soy is better for the environment, while ethically sourced beeswax supports beekeepers & pollination\u2014choose wisely!  Beeswax is widely considered the healthiest candle wax due to its clean burn, minimal soot production, and natural air-purifying properties. It emits no harmful toxins and is hypoallergenic, making it ideal for people with allergies or respiratory sensitivities. Beeswax candles are better for those seeking the cleanest burn and longest burn time. They are hypoallergenic and emit a subtle honey scent without additives. Soy candles, however, excel in affordability, fragrance throw, and sustainability when made from non-GMO soybeans. The choice depends on your priorities: health and longevity (beeswax) or cost-effectiveness and scent variety (soy) Beeswax is the healthiest candle wax to burn due to its natural composition, clean burn, and ability to release negative ions that may help reduce indoor pollutants. Organic beeswax candles are even better as they are free from pesticides. Soy wax is also a healthy alternative but may emit trace pollutants if mixed with synthetic fragrances Beeswax candles last significantly longer than soy candles due to their higher melting point and dense structure. For example, a 100g beeswax candle can burn for approximately 29 hours compared to 18 hours for a soy candle of the same size. This makes beeswax the better choice for durability. Soy wax has a few drawbacks: it has a lower melting point, making it sensitive to heat and prone to softening or warping in warm conditions. It may also have a subtler scent throw compared to paraffin or beeswax candles. Additionally, most soy crops are genetically modified and heavily treated with pesticides unless labeled organic or non-GMO. Millie Chamberlain is a passionate medical writer based in London.

Many thanks, enjoying wearing the jacket and look forward to seeing what the next project you're all working on will be! Heavy duty, stylish jacket. Looks and feels, good. Well made and excellent value for money. Gorgeous quality, love the rich green colour, and feels amazing. I know I'm going to get so much wear out of it already. (The only thing I would say is that I had to size up for the fit I want but it means the arms are a bit long, but nothing rolling them up can't fix!). Super pleased with my canvas jacket!

We recommend switching to Edge, Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.      \nBrowse categories\n \nBrowse categories\n \nBrowse categories\n Hey friend, I'm Sam, founder of Yes Friends. Here's the story. A decade ago, I was in a fitting room trying on some jeans and my conscience said \"you can't buy anything that's not ethical\". It was 2013 and I was thinking about sweatshops and workers' wages.Fast forward a few years, I had moved to Bristol,\u00a0studied\u00a0music and set-up a\u00a0sustainable\u00a0& ethical fashion boutique in a shipping container. I wanted to make ethical clothing accessible.\u00a0But there was one problem, nobody could afford it.In 2020, I was being interviewed for a sustainable fashion blog. On a day that would usually warrant lighting a fire indoors, we sat outside.\u00a0COVID times.As we were getting used to mild hypothermia, the interviewer said \u201cI\u2019ve heard it costs \u00a330 to make a fully ethical T-shirt\u201d. \u00a0I thought\u00a0hmmm.I\u2019d heard that kind of thing loads before. I knew it wasn\u2019t true.\u00a0But it\u2019s what everyone thinks.Over the past few years, I'd had a front row seat watching supply chains, pricing and mark-ups. It was in that little shipping container that I discovered sustainable & ethical fashion doesn\u2019t need to be expensive.\u00a0But it does require big scale and smaller margins. A bit like going to Costco. But on another level. I\u00a0knew this idea was\u00a0way\u00a0bigger than me.\u00a0So I put together a team; Dan, Johnny, Tundun and Hannah.\u00a0I had met Dan and Johnny at a wedding a few weeks before that freezing interview. Dan was a marketing strategist for Apple and Johnny was constantly being quoted in national newspapers. They were good people to know.Tundun was a friend of a friend, a wizard on photoshop and was ready to work her magic on a new brand. I'd known Hannah the longest, she's a paid ads guru and loves start-ups, a natural fit.We had our first team. In January 2021 we started building Yes Friends.\u00a0We came up with a name, made a logo, tried on\u00a0loads\u00a0of T-shirts and with the help of some friends at a creative agency, filmed our\u00a0first ad. Then on 7th April 2021 we launched the \u00a37.99 sustainable & ethical T-shirt.It was a crazy month, selling over 4,000 T-shirts. Receiving national news coverage. Being featured in a letter to the CEOs of ASOS, Boohoo and H&M by over 100 MPs and peers. And receiving a \"Great\" rating from Good On You.It was a wild time. And all because of people just like you, sharing, liking, encouraging and shopping. You made and continue to make Yes Friends work.Fast forward a couple of months and we sent out an email titled \"Dragons Den and Yes Friends\". We were pitching for investment. Minimum buy-in was \u00a35k. Over the coming months we raised \u00a3150k and set about launching new products and having more impact on garment workers than we'd ever had before.Let me rewind.There's a part of the story I didn't mention.\u00a0Just after that infamous interview, I knew if we were going to make Yes Friends work, we'd need to know exactly what product to make. So\u00a0I put up a poll on Instagram and one hundred people put their ideas into a mahusive hat, telling me about their favourite T-shirts.\u00a0We then set about making that T-shirt. And that's how we continue design products at Yes Friends - together.\u00a0Since that first poll, thousands of you have had your say on what styles and colours you want us to make next.\u00a0On our collection pages you\u2019ll find our latest ideas and can have your say.\u00a0Together, we're building the\u00a0hottest\u00a0collection of sustainable and ethical clothing on the internet.\u00a0We couldn't do this without you.So that's the story of Yes Friends. Building a brand together, to change the fashion industry. It's been a wild ride and this is just the start.If you want to keep up to date with new products and follow along the journey, sign-up to the newsletter below, follow along on socials, or you can read more of our story\u00a0here.Together, let's transform the fashion industry \ud83e\udde1Sam & The Yes Friends Team Join 21,632 people (give or take a few) who are the first to hear about product launches and behind-the-scenes stories from Yes Friends. \nHelpful Links\n Our Mission Yes Friends exists to make ethical clothing affordable and transform the fashion industry.

Nobody wants that either.And not buying clothes isn\u2019t an option either (nobody wants to see that).So we started Yes Friends to make ethical clothing affordable and transform the fashion industry. Image \u00a9\ufe0f Evolution3 What we're doing differently We run a pioneering bonus scheme for garment workers, to ensure they receive a good wage. It's why we do what we do. We work with Fair Trade and Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified factories to ensure good social and environmental practices. We work with a range of industry leading certifications to ensure our ethical credentials. We have also received the highest rating from ethical brand directory Good On You. We work with Fairtrade and Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) to trace our supply chain. We do not use animal products in the making of Yes Friends clothing. All our cotton is organic. Better for farmers, the planet and your skin. Both our partner factories are solar power assisted, reducing the use of CO2 during production.\u00a0 Our primary factory in India where Yes Friends knit, cut & sew production takes place processes and recycles 100% of their water. We work with Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified factories and dyes to avoid the use of toxic chemicals in production.\u00a0 We make premium quality clothing without the price tag. We buy in big quantities and miss out the retailer, passing the savings on to you. Reduce, reuse, recycle. Our factories recycle their offcuts from production. We package your garments in our signature flaming hot orange bags, made from 30% recycled plastic (they're also 100% recyclable and biodegradable!) to keep your clothing safe on it's way to you. The Yes Friends BonusWe run a pioneering bonus scheme for garment workers, to ensure they receive a good wage. It's why we do what we do. For Yes Friends garments, we pay an additional bonus directly to the garment workers. This means they are paid a good wage for every Yes Friends product made. Did you know? Adding as little as 10p to the price of a T-shirt can increase workers wages by a whopping 50%. Sounds like magic, but it\u2019s just maths. Magic Maths.\u00a0The bigger we get, the bigger impact we can have.P.S.\u00a0We're also the first UK brand to allow customers to directly tip their garment workers! Check out the feature on our product pages.Read about the impact the Yes Friends bonus is having here.How do we calculate the Yes Friends bonus?Our goal is that every garment worker across the fashion industry is paid a living wage. We've set-up a pioneering bonus scheme to ensure that garment workers are paid a good wage for making Yes Friends clothing. Here's how we calculate the bonus for workers at our primary factory, Fabstract Clothing.\u00a0First, we find out what the lowest paid workers wage is. We then calculate how long it takes a worker to knit, cut, sew, wash and pack each of our garments. We then use the Global Living Wage Coalition's (GLWC) definition of a living wage and find their report on the location closest to where Yes Friends is made. We then research any living cost variation between this location and the location of our factory and adjust the GLWC figure accordingly. We also look at what trade union's are asking for, to give an additional reference point, so far the GLWC figure has always been significantly higher.Using all this information, we look at the difference between the lowest paid workers wage and the GLWC wage and work out how much extra per garment we will need to pay, to pay our part towards a living wage. We then send this bonus to our factory and it is distributed via payroll evenly among the workers at the solar factory where our bulk production takes place.Currently, on a T-shirt the additional bonus on top of their salary is 27p.The bigger we get, the bigger impact we can have. We want to gain enough buying power to ensure that all workers receive a living wage.To find out about how the bonus is calculated on our hoodies, you can read more\u00a0here. Solar Powered Factories Both our partner factories are solar power assisted, reducing the use of CO2 during production.\u00a0Our primary factory in India where all our current range is made (minus hoodies) gets 50% of its energy from solar power and the rest from non-polluting natural gas. They also have a\u00a0humongous\u00a0battery so that during power cuts they aren't reliant on polluting diesel generators.\u00a0Organic Cotton\u00a0 We only use organic cotton which produces 46% less CO2\u00a0than conventional cotton.\u00b9\u00b9https://www.soilassociation.org/certification/fashion-textiles/benefits-of-organic-certification/ We only use organic cotton. It's a win, win, win, win.One. Organic cotton is primarily rain-fed, reducing the need for water irrigation.\u00b9Two. Most of our organic cotton is grown, spun, knitted, cut & sewn in India. So it\u2019s not trekking around the world from one factory to another racking up carbon miles.Three. We don\u2019t use pesky pesticides or toxic chemicals which means happy soil, happy farmers and happy skin. Four. Oh, and did we mention it feels like you\u2019re wearing a cloud? \u26c5\ufe0fFairtrade CottonWhere we can we also work with Fairtrade cotton to improve the lives of cotton farmers. Look out for the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark on our product pages. Fairtrade cotton ensures that all cotton farmers receive the Fairtrade Minimum Price and the Fairtrade Premium (an additional sum of money which goes into a communal fund for workers and farmers to use \u2013 as they see fit \u2013 to improve their social, economic and environmental conditions). \u00b9https://store.textileexchange.org/wp-content/uploads/woocommerce_uploads/2019/09/TE-Material-Snapshot_Cotton-Organic.pdfA little more detail \ud83d\udc47How much of the Yes Friends collection uses organic cotton?All of our range is made using organic cotton. Most Yes Friends products use 100% organic cotton. The least amount of organic cotton we use in a product is 95%, which is combined with 5% elastane to give a little stretch.Are Yes Friends products Fairtrade certified?The majority of Yes Friends products are made using Fairtrade cotton, lookout for the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark on our product pages to check if a particular product is made using Fairtrade cotton.Are Yes Friends products GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certified?We've always bought organic cotton and our manufacturers are GOTS certified. All of the Yes Friends products have been made to the GOTS standard and in May 2024 we started certifying all new products with the GOTS logo. Lookout for the GOTS logo on our product pages to see which products have the GOTS certification. We work with Fairtrade and GOTS certified factories to ensure good labour practices, you can read all about our recent visit to our primary factory (and the wedding of the factory owner's son!)\u00a0here. We also have a Supplier Code of Conduct based on the Ethical Trading Intiative's Base Code which you can read here. Our primary* factory in India where Yes Friends knit, cut & sew production takes place is water positive: 100% of water used is processed and recycled through either a reserve osmosis process or at the Effluent Treatment Plant onsite. They also have a rainwater harvesting system that recharges groundwater.Organic CottonOrganic cotton uses significantly less water than conventional cotton and isn't sprayed with toxic chemicals keeping waterways cleaner.\u00b9*The factory where all of Yes Friends current range is made, minus hoodies.\u00b9https://www.soilassociation.org/certification/fashion-textiles/benefits-of-organic-certification/ All of our collection is dyed using GOTS certified dyes (Global Organic Textile Standard). We work with organic cotton and GOTS certified factories to avoid the use of toxic chemicals in production.\u00a0 Yes Friends exists to make ethical fashion affordable, whilst producing premium quality clothing that'll stand the test of time.

We'll either have the information to hand or we can find out what you'd like to know about our mills, screen printers, yarn suppliers etc!Over the coming years we'd like to find a good way of communicating this information with all of you, so you can see the full Yes Friends supply chain when buying from us.

Visit www.info.fairtrade.netOur most recent batch of T-shirts have the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark on the label, but some T-shirts from previous batches don\u2019t include the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark.Here\u2019s the reason why:In order to use the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark the full supply chain for the cotton needs to be certified by FLOCERT (the global independent certification body for Fairtrade). Our factory already had GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and Fair Trade USA certification, but in order to label goods with the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark, they also needed to be certified by FLOCERT. So over the past year, we\u2019ve been working with the Fairtrade system and our factory to obtain certification for the seed cotton we use. This year, the factory received the certification which means the seed cotton used in the T-shirts is now fully traceable throughout the supply chain, so our latest T-shirts now include the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark \ud83d\ude4c   \nTip Your Garment Workers\n \nFrom \u00a31   \u00a0 The organic cotton is pre-shrunk before cutting & sewing to minimise shrinkage, but do allow for a small amount of shrinkage on first wash (3-4%). \u00a0 We run a pioneering bonus scheme for garment workers, to ensure they receive a good wage.

Visit www.info.fairtrade.netOur most recent batch of T-shirts have the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark on the label, but some T-shirts from previous batches don\u2019t include the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark.Here\u2019s the reason why:In order to use the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark the full supply chain for the cotton needs to be certified by FLOCERT (the global independent certification body for Fairtrade).

It\u2019s a way to make the long UK winter go by faster. Some people in England hibernate. Others fill up their social calendar. And a few close their eyes and eat as much imported Costa Rican pineapple as they dare, hoping to bring the equator a little closer. We\u2019re learning to do an axel stall.\u00a0 It\u2019s one of the most basic mini ramp tricks, where you throw yourself onto the top of the ramp and stay there for a few seconds, pondering your fate.It\u2019s terrifying at times.\u00a0 When you first step onto that piece of wood and wheels, you\u2019re very aware, you\u2019re not in control yet. Gravity gets to bully you for a while. You have to forget this. You need to think, gravity schmavity. \u00a0 Otherwise, you stay off the board. And when you\u2019re standing at the top of said mini ramp (and mini is a very deceiving term in this world \u2013 you\u2019re still several feet above the ground), when you\u2019re balancing the board on the lip of the drop, about to fall downward, you have to pretend\u2026 You have to pretend you\u2019re slightly invincible.\u00a0 One of our friends (we\u2019ve never met but he likes our T-shirts) is doing something similar. He says our heavyweight T-shirt is helping. Have you ever read one of those Amazon reviews which are written like Hemingway got bored on a sunny Friday afternoon and decided to tell the world what he thought of his latest toaster? Well, we never thought we\u2019d be on the receiving end of one of these reviews, but last year, Oliver made our day. Keep reading, it\u2019s a work of art. I never thought I'd find happiness in a t-shirt, but here I am, grinning like a maniac because of this tee. This marvel of fabric engineering is nothing short of life-changing. First off, it's called \"heavyweight\" because it's built like a tank. I'm pretty sure I could survive a minor apocalypse in this thing. Forget about ever needing a bulletproof vest\u2014just layer up with a few of these bad boys, and you're good to go!It\u2019s nice to know that Oliver\u2019s strategy for surviving the zombie apocalypse is to layer up our heavyweight T-shirts. These things are pretty heavy duty.\u00a0 They\u2019re 240gsm.\u00a0 A bit of maths for you: Our first ever tee was 155gsm. So this is an extra 54% of pure organic cotton. If you thought Oliver\u2019s enthusiasm was exhausted at this point, you\u2019d be wrong. He goes on\u2026 The fit? Perfect. It's like the shirt was tailored by an angel who knows exactly how I like my sleeves to sit and my torso to breathe. And comfort? It's like being hugged by a cloud made of kittens that are themselves wearing tiny, comfy sweaters.We suspect Oliver is using a little hyperbole. But he\u2019s kind of right too.\u00a0 Our heavyweight T-shirt is made with a 40s count (aka soft) organic cotton,\u00a0 It\u2019s knitted by thousands of needles working in seamless motion to create an interlock weave. We\u2019ve been wearing them ourselves this March and \u201clike being hugged by a cloud made of kittens\u201d is not far from the truth. Did you think Oliver was done. Nooope.\u00a0 This man writes reviews the way others write dramatic novellas. Kudos.But the best part? The sheer joy it brings. I'm not just wearing a shirt; I'm wearing a statement. A statement that says, \"I\u2019m ready for anything life throws at me, and I\u2019ll look ridiculously good handling it.\" Strangers have complimented me, old friends have reconnected, and I\u2019m pretty sure my dog respects me more now. In short, this tee isn't just a piece of clothing\u2014it's an experience, a lifestyle, and possibly the key to world peace. Get one. Get five. Just prepare to be excessively happy and slightly invincible.And there it is. We think Oliver deserves a round of applause. This is the ticket to being slightly invincible. Or at least pretending you are. So if you\u2019re learning to skateboard this spring\u2026 Or if you just want to step into the first warmish day of March wearing a single layer.\u00a0 For the glorious moment when you finally go outside again wearing just a T-shirt. This is that T-shirt. Lovingly made by Mihir and his team at our fair trade, solar powered factory. Ethical clothing that feels expensive, but is in fact affordable. A Ferrari for the price of a Fiesta. Ready to cushion the falls of life for you. BECOME SLIGHTLY INVINCIBLE P.S. We framed Oliver\u2019s review by the way, it\u2019s hanging on the door of our office.Until next time, friends. Our heavyweight T-shirt is waiting for you to feel like you're being hugged by a cloud of kittens.

They\u2019ve just arrived in our office, chatting about indie films, and leaning back on our chairs in the way your school teacher told you not to. No doubt they all got good grades in school without trying too hard.\u00a0 They\u2019re smart-casual in a way that makes you appreciate what the words smart and casual really mean.

Hiking in the Brecon Beacons.\u201d\u00a0 It didn\u2019t happen when you checked the BBC weather app - only minus 2 degrees - and you bundled into a Volvo with a good friend and a good coat. It didn\u2019t happen after you drove up the M5, through the single tracks of Wales, and when you finally arrived at the foot of the mountain. It didn\u2019t happen when you started walking up that mountain and realised snow was covering the paths, so you couldn\u2019t tell where you were on the map. It didn\u2019t happen when the snow wept through your new boots. It happened when you reached the top, when the wind picked up, catching fistfuls of snow and throwing it in your face like some teenager tossing snowballs in a Christmas movie. Except it\u2019s not Christmas and now you can\u2019t see and there\u2019s a scary ledge over there and the wind\u2019s blowing you towards it, and how in actual heck does anyone climb Everest? That\u2019s when you realised: you\u2019d bitten off more than you can chew.Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve been there. And not just when we were on that surprisingly perilous mountainside in February \u201822. We\u2019ve bitten off more than we can chew plenty of times. Case in point: Back in 2021, we ordered waaay too many hoodies. We\u2019re talking 3,626 hoodies.\u00a0 And only in two colours.\u00a0 The Sage Green was pretty hot, but \u00a359,704 worth of hoodies is a lot to get off your shelves when it\u2019s the second item of clothing you\u2019ve ever released as a company.In the optimism of our early days we thought hoodies would move as quickly as our T-shirts. But it turns out hoodies don\u2019t sell as fast. Not then anyway. It\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t love them: they got over 90 five-star reviews. It\u2019s just, in 2021, not quite enough people knew about our little Bristol-based clothing company. So the unsold ones stared at us every day, lecturing us on the merits of conservative stock ordering. Now and then we\u2019d get through another box of hoodies and we\u2019d say \u201canother one bites the dust.\u201d We wondered if these black and sage green hoodies would always be with us. But this year, that changed. Today, there\u2019s only two left. They\u2019re a small part of our new winter sale.We don\u2019t do sales much. We try to make Yes Friends as affordable as possible, every single day. But almost all of these fashion pieces have become so rare on our shelves that it\u2019s time to see them go: There\u2019s only 15 Women's Luxe Tencel Pyjamas\u00a0and only one (!) Faded Pink T-shirt\u00a0left.\u00a0 Props to whoever gets that T-shirt. Maybe, back in 2021, we did bite off more than we can chew, but it was all part of us learning how to create an ethical and affordable way of doing this thing called fashion. Changing the fashion industry is more like taking on Everest than the Beacons. But with you, we\u2019re climbing it. All of our sale items are lovingly made by our friends in India, who, thanks to you, receive a good wage through our bonus scheme and any tips you send their way. We\u2019ve just heard some stories of how they\u2019re using your latest tips, and we look forward to sharing more very, very soon. For now, as you climb Everest with us, you can shop a few of our rarer items at unbelievably good prices.\nGO TO SALE  P.S. If your package goes AWOL \ud83d\udc47007 goes AWOL, Jack Reacher goes AWOL, the Royal Mail can also go AWOL.\u00a0 Maybe Benjamin\u2019s fleece was tired from the road and stopped to sip Martinis somewhere between South Bristol and\u2026 well, North Bristol.\u00a0 This package didn\u2019t have far to go, but the fleece had already made its way across the Arabian Sea and that can be a hard journey, so maybe we can give the fleece a break \u2013 sounds like Benjamin did. Glad you\u2019re hyped about the fleece and the company.\u00a0 Maybe like Benjamin, you won\u2019t get enough of this fleece too. Good news: there\u2019s a handful left in our new sale. You know what to do.\nA FLAMING HOT ORANGE BUTTON Together, let's make ethical affordable and transform the fashion industry \ud83e\udde1 YF.

The color of the backpack was accurate to what I saw online and I'm happy with it. It's a good overall backpack but I do think it would benefit from better internal pockets and protective padding. The laptop sleeve is nice but there is no padding at the bottom of the laptop sleeve so I always have to be delicate when placing it down on a hard surface. The pocket on the inside of the backpack is unfortunately lackluster, it is very loose and gets in the way of other items inside the backpack(books, planners, etc). I would say it's the most disappointing part of the backpack and is the main reason why this item does not get 5 stars, including the lack of protective padding for the laptop sleeve. It's a nice backpack though and I appreciate it more knowing it is sustainable. great backpack, good quality, without plastic Backpack 2 review Well-made and designed, heavy duty backpack. Pros:\n* Not made of plastic\n* Appears to be good quality and durable Possible improvements: The bag is quite rough to the touch. The top handle is especially uncomfortable to use. I see complaints about it being a magnet for loose fibers and pet hair. If it's picking up microplastic fibers when I'm out and about, I'd be quite sad about that. You might consider selling an oil or wax treatment which should help with that issue, while also making the bag less rough to the touch and more water resistant. I would really appreciate more small pockets for organization purposes. A button+flap closure on the top pocket inside the bag would be nice too. Thanks for making this bag!

When you choose fair trade products, you are a part of the movement that promotes and support sustainability throughout the supply chain. The item didn't take too long to arrive. The color of the backpack was accurate to what I saw online and I'm happy with it. It's a good overall backpack but I do think it would benefit from better internal pockets and protective padding. The laptop sleeve is nice but there is no padding at the bottom of the laptop sleeve so I always have to be delicate when placing it down on a hard surface. The pocket on the inside of the backpack is unfortunately lackluster, it is very loose and gets in the way of other items inside the backpack(books, planners, etc). I would say it's the most disappointing part of the backpack and is the main reason why this item does not get 5 stars, including the lack of protective padding for the laptop sleeve. It's a nice backpack though and I appreciate it more knowing it is sustainable. great backpack, good quality, without plastic Backpack 2 review Well-made and designed, heavy duty backpack. Pros:\n* Not made of plastic\n* Appears to be good quality and durable Possible improvements: The bag is quite rough to the touch. The top handle is especially uncomfortable to use. I see complaints about it being a magnet for loose fibers and pet hair. If it's picking up microplastic fibers when I'm out and about, I'd be quite sad about that. You might consider selling an oil or wax treatment which should help with that issue, while also making the bag less rough to the touch and more water resistant.

I\u2019m a grad student and normally use a backpack to carry all my school stuff (laptop, books, water, pencils, etc) but recently I\u2019ve been studying at local coffee shops and preferred to carry my things in a tote bag. This bag has been great! The material feels thick and sturdy, the inner pockets are perfect for my Mac and Hydroflask, and the front pocket is big enough to hold my glasses, pencil pouch, wallet, and AirPods. I usually use the back pocket to carry an extra bag for groceries or my phone while I\u2019m walking. I only wish this bag had a zipper for the main compartment. The lavender color is also kind of blue-purple, but I really like it. I ordered 5 executive tote bags for the girls in my family for Christmas. I know they will love the quality and size. They are sturdy and can easily hold laptops and much more. They have a wide range of colors but I was conservative going with Charcoal and Black which I\u2019m sure they will like. The shipping was fast giving me time to wrap them for Christmas. \nI would definitely order them again! I hope you make more shoulder bags! Love it! Love that it\u2019s not leather and made by a caring company Terra Thread\u2019s work tote bag measures H16 x W14 x G4 inches in size and weighs about 1.3 lbs. It\u2019s compact, lightweight, and roomy enough to carry all your daily essentials with ease. The Terra Thread work tote features a spacious main compartment, an inner laptop sleeve for devices up to 15 inches, a dedicated pocket for up to 32 oz water bottles (inside), a front exterior pocket, and back pockets. Yes, this work tote bag has a dedicated laptop compartment designed to fit laptops up to 15 inches securely and comfortably. This tote bag and the rest of our bags are made of certified organic cotton. This particular tote doesn\u2019t feature a trolley sleeve. However, we do have a travel tote bag with this functionality, perfect for frequent travelers. This tote bag\u2019s straps are not adjustable or padded, but the straps are comfortable. This tote bag has a fixed drop handle that measures 12 inches. It\u2019s designed to be sturdy and comfortable, even when the bag is fully loaded. This Work Tote Bag is not water-resistant, as it\u2019s made of 100% organic cotton canvas. Explore Explore Let's Stay in Touch  Country/region \n\n\n",

Ordered this mini backpack and was super happy with the quality of the fabric and the zippers! It washes well and air dries quickly! Also happy with the green color! And it looks super cute! Yay!!! It\u2019s such a vibrant color turquoise, beautiful lightweight but sturdy canvas. I bought separately the matching color pencil case. It\u2019s so perfect for me for college when I\u2019m not carrying too much around. Otherwise I have the bigger Terra Thread backpack too and love it. The environmental consciousness of the brand appeals to me, but also how functional yet simplistic their well stitched heavy duty canvas products are. I feel like I can make them last years and years, but they look good too. :) Shipping was crazy fast and once I got the bag you could feel the difference in quality compared to others. I would definitely recommend this for someone who doesn\u2019t like to carry around purses ! I got this over the summer for my kindergartener to use as his main school pack and it's been perfect! We sewed on a few patches. It fits his folder, lunchbox, water, and a sweater perfectly. Sweet little backpack\u2014just the right size for a sketchbook and all the necessities. Love the orange! Our mini backpack is 13 inches tall, 10.5 inches wide, and 4 inches deep, with a total capacity of about 9 liters. It's compact yet spacious enough to fit your everydayessentials. Terra Thread\u2019s mini backpack has a spacious main compartment along with an internal hanging pocket for small items. Plus, there\u2019s a zippered external pocket for quick access to your essentials. Yes. It can hold a tablet or a compact laptop up to 14 inches, making it handy for work, school, or personal use. The backpack comes in a variety of shades, ranging from muted tones like sand dune to vibrant options like ruby red, so there\u2019s something for every style preference. The mini backpack is made from 100% organic cotton canvas, and it is not water-resistant. But it\u2019s built to withstand light moisture. For heavy rain, keep it sheltered to protect your items.  The mini backpacks are crafted from 100% organic cotton canvas and produced in Fair Trade Certified factories, ensuring ethical and eco-friendly practices.

Sturdy and spacious, looking forward to taking it on many walks all summer long! Not too big, not too small, wearable on your hip or as a tiny sling bag\u2014the Cadera Fanny Pack is ready to roll when you are. Pack your essentials in this eco-friendly fanny pack made with organic cotton canvas when you want to move through the day with your hands-free. Your purchase also supports Feeding America's campaign to end hunger by helping donate meals to kids and families in need. I absolutely love this bag! It is very well made and the perfect size. Sometimes I do not need to carry a large bag and this fits all my essentials. I can fit my phone, wallet, keys, and sunglasses in it. Plus I really like that I can wear it as a fanny pack or a sling bag (however I would like it to be a bit smaller when wearing it around my waist). I am super happy with my purchase! As Advertised I love the color of this fanny bag, however, it is not made for athletic/toned waists! The strap won't adjust to a smaller waist so it kind of sags a bit. I love that it's organic! The Cadera Fanny Pack is a thoughtfully designed bag that blends practicality with sustainability. It keeps your essentials close and your hands-free when on the go. Wear it on your hip or as a sling bag. Fanny packs come in a variety of materials. The Cadera Fanny Pack is made from certified organic cotton, offering a more sustainable and stylish option. There\u2019s no one way to wear it. You can keep it classic around your waist, sling it across your chest for a modern touch, or wear it over your shoulder for a laid-back look.

Really happy with this bag. It fits a lot more than I expected it to. Great quality and from a great mission driven company :) I have a bunch of stuff from Terra Thread at this point. My Mom and Sister just got me a moss green gym bag for Christmas, and I love it. The color is beautiful, and it's the same high quality cotton and construction that I really like from the other stuff I have from Terra Thread. I have started to use it as my pickleball bag, and it fits a pickleball paddle fully inside, which is great. Love my new heck of durable, top notch quality organic cotton canvas bag! The green color is lush. Ill use this bag with pride for all my travels. Thanks couldn't be more pleased!! The gym bag is 11 inches high, 18 inches wide, and 10 inches deep. This size gives you enough room for all your gym essentials without being too bulky. No, it does not. However, there is an internal zippered pocket for small items and an external pocket where you can store smaller wet items like socks and swimsuits.  Yes, you can machine wash the gym bag separately in cold water. After washing, we recommend line drying it. Just be sure not to use bleach or dry clean the bag. For everyday cleaning, simply spot clean with a soft damp cloth.  The gym bag has a capacity of 32L, so it can easily handle your gym clothes, shoes, water bottles, towels, and personal items. Terra Thread\u2019s gym bag is made from 100% organic cotton canvas. Not only is it eco-friendly, but it\u2019s also made in Fair Trade Certified\u2122 factories, making it a responsible choice for your gym gear. Yes, this gym bag holds GOTS and two Fairtrade certifications (one for cotton and one for the factory). Our gym bags are made with organic and fairtrade cotton at Fair Trade Certified factories.

With a high waist and wide straight leg, Larry delivers a roomy silhouette that balances modernity with vintage denim heritage. Made with rigid denim.\n\n\n Re-use Gold are the most rare and beautiful examples\nof Create Tomorrow's Vintage in practice. BIG NEWS! Solid Ollie is our modern take on slim\u2014straight leg, plenty of room, but keeps it slim where it matters.\u2028\u2028 This heavyweight selvage holds a special place in our hearts. Initially unveiled in 2015 under the name \"Steady Eddie Dry Heavy Japan Selvage,\" it was a limited edition, with only 1000 pairs in existence, rendering it a rare gem.  Revived from the past, these jeans are crafted from deadstock fabrics. Each pair is a patchwork of history, reinvented to create a modern fit with a vintage soul. One Wash is inspired by the simplest treatment\u2014a single home wash for dry denim. This shifts the hue from dark bluish-grey to rich redcast blue, enhancing the texture from flat to irregular. Wide Heidi is the opposite of the last twenty years - low, wide and swaying! The collaboration between Nudie Jeans and Jeff Olsson isn't just about merging fashion with art; it's about intertwining two worlds that share a love for the mystique, the mythical, and the melancholic. These exceptional qualities pay homage to the expertise of Japanese denim artisans, who possess a deep understanding of both the old and the new. Designed for the present while undoubtedly destined to become tomorrow's vintage. We are reintroducing the Flare Glenn fit. Born in 2001, Glenn is one of the very first designs created by Maria Levin for Nudie Jeans. Back then, it was a progressive fit that became an icon, instrumental in creating the unique Nudie Jeans aesthetic.

        "Your wishlist is empty. This heavyweight selvage holds a special place in our hearts. Initially unveiled in 2015 under the name \"Steady Eddie Dry Heavy Japan Selvage,\" it was a limited edition, with only 1000 pairs in existence, rendering it a rare gem. However, every time we come across a worn pair of these jeans, they never fail to leave us spellbound. The visual ruggedness of the denim first captures the eye, and upon picking them up, the weight and tactility immediately confirm that this denim is truly extraordinary. So extraordinary that, almost a decade later, we approached Kaihara to weave this exceptional selvage once more \u2013 a challenging feat realized on vintage shuttle looms. As the master denim craftsmen that Kaihara is, we were confident they would accept the challenge, and we are sincerely humbled that they did. What draws us to heavy denim are two main qualities. First, the way it feels\u2014its substantial rigidity and texture, both when you hold it and when you wear it. Second, the way it breaks in. Heavier, thicker denim forms softer creases, creating bolder wear patterns. The thicker yarns amplify the texture, highlighting the twill weave and the yarn\u2019s irregularities as it ages and evolves.\u00a0So, while you might end up with jeans that are more durable, what we truly value are the tactile and aesthetic qualities that set heavyweight denim apart. Its rigidity and unique break-in process offer something distinct compared to mid-weight denim. Steady Eddie II Gravity Selvage is also available at a select few resellers.

Crafted from our \"Painter Denim,\" a deeply saturated pure indigo 2/1 denim, this jacket is detailed with Nudie Jeans' signature orange thread and stainless steel \"Donut\" buttons. The result is a meticulously crafted, vintage-inspired denim with an expertly tailored fit, brought to life by the bold contrast of our signature orange thread. A thoughtful reinterpretation of traditional workwear, blending past influences with Nudie Jeans' aesthetic.\r\n\r\nCurious about the \"Painter Denim\"? We're glad you asked. We spent years meticulously developing this fabric to achieve the look and feel of classic 2/1 workwear denim. Made from irregular ring-spun yarns in both warp and weft, the warp is yarn-dyed to a deep pure indigo tone, while the weft is dyed a grey shade. Woven in a 2/1 Z construction, the fabric presents a flatter surface compared to the more common 3/1 denim, resulting in a uniform rich blue hue. With a substantial weight of 11.8 oz, this robust denim offers durability and a dynamic break-in journey. As it ages, the stiffness creates natural creases, while the irregular texture and deep indigo tones evolve, revealing beautiful highs and lows over time. The supplier and origin of raw material.

Made from undyed organic cotton, spun into irregular yarns with varying slubs, and woven on vintage Swiss \"Ruti\" shuttle looms, the result is magnificent. This denim exudes a vintage-like surface texture and hand, resulting in an elegantly rustic aesthetic. The selvage-id - although a detail - is well though through too, the outmost yarns are red while the middle yarns are undyed - the result is different from the norm, and sharply finessful. \r\n\r\nBeing slightly, slightly nerdy when it comes to denim, we are not easily impressed, particularly when it comes to undyed denim. However, the Ivory Selvage stands out as a remarkable exception to the rule. While it may lack the dye-related aging properties, its complex texture and tactile quality more than compensate for this.

This 14.5 oz. denim boasts a tight weave density and generous starch application, ensuring remarkable rigidity. But what truly distinguishes it is its exceptional aging property, a testament to Kurabo Mills' blend of heritage and innovative denim craftsmanship.\r\n\r\nThis denim stands out due to its unique construction: the warp, visible predominantly on the fabric's face, is yarn-dyed black, allowing it to gradually fade with wear and washes. Conversely, the weft, visible on predominantly on the fabric's back, is dyed with a 'stay black' dye, retaining its deep black hue without fading. Although this might seem unconventional for fading denim, it yields intriguing contrasts, emphasizing the warp-weft intersections. This clever construction promises more pronounced contrasting fades compared to regular dry black denim.\r\n\r\nBeyond its unique yarn combination, the denim's tight weave, stiff texture, pronounced twill lines and slightly coarse yarns create an exquisite surface structure and marbling effects with wear and washes. \r\n\r\nFor optimal results, we recommend wearing our dry denim regularly for at least six months before the first wash. While entirely optional, this period encourages striking fades.  The supplier and origin of raw material. The suppliers involved in turning raw material into yarn.

True to history it is constructed of ring-spun warp and weft yarns with irregular thickness, as was often the case back in the day on workwear fabrics. Also true to its heritage is the dark, but not blackish, indigo warp that is dyed in pure indigo.\r\n\r\nWith wear and wash, the yarns will interact, and you'll reap the rewards that heavier ring-spun denim produces \u2014 evident slubs, a pleasing crosshatch as well as a marbling -effect. It's the irregular yarns in both warp and weft that render the crosshatch effect, and the built-in tension formed by the yarns that produce the marble effect after washing. As this denim is dyed in pure indigo, it will age to a clean, blue redcast tone.\r\n\r\nThe greatest part of these jeans is not what they look like new, but rather the complete opposite - how they will look tomorrow, and the many days to come.

The pockets are securely attached with single stitches that form small triangles at the pocket openings, reinforcing both functionality and aesthetics. The main seams are sewn with felled twin-needle seams, providing a clean and sturdy construction. From its silhouette to its making Buddy is our love for simplistic workwear jackets condensed into one, simple and beautiful, jacket. \n\nThis particular Buddy jacket is crafted from exquisite herringbone twill fabric. Its tightly woven construction gives it a slightly crisp texture, a dry feel, and a smooth appearance. The pattern of the fabric pays homage to vintage herringbone twills, and to ensure longevity and desirable aging property, we have piece-dyed it in a perfect Walnut shade. The jacket has undergone a gentle wash, subtly accentuating the fabric's characteristics and garment construction.\n\nCurious to learn more about herringbone twill? We're delighted you asked! Herringbone twill is a variation of the regular twill weaving pattern. While regular twill, as seen in denim, exhibits a distinct diagonal pattern, herringbone twill features broken diagonal lines, creating a noticeable zig-zag pattern (more prominent than in a broken twill). The zig-zag pattern, resembling the bone structure of a herring, is compact yet distinctive. Herringbone twill is commonly found in vintage workwear jackets, particularly those of French and German origin, often in blue or grey hues. Moreover, it is well-known for its usage in vintage military fatigues, commonly referred to by its acronym HBT. The choice of herringbone twill in workwear and military garments can, to our knowledge, be attributed to two primary reasons. Firstly, the alteration of the twill direction enhances tear resistance. Secondly, during a time when sanforization and skewing processes were not yet developed, herringbone twill exhibited a reduced tendency to skew compared to regular twill. This aspect, similar to the purpose behind the development of broken twill, contributed to its popularity. There you have it, the ins and outs of herringbone twill. Wash only when needed.

Softly washed to vibrant shades of indigo with authentic wearmarks, these jeans have achieved an vintage appearance with intricate detailing and great comfort.\r\n\r\nThis broken twill denim was meticulously developed to achieve a dense and substantial weight with apparent softness\u2014a unique combination uncommon in regular denim but perfectly suited for broken twill. Drawing inspiration from a wide range of vintage broken twill denim pieces, we carefully crafted this fabric to create our best-ever broken twill denim. The tactility is sturdy yet soft, boasting a rich vintage-like hand. The texture is flat and uniform, with subtly irregular yarn slub adding an important textural contrast. The indigo and sulfur-dyed mid-blue warp yarns allow the denim to age gracefully into magical aquatic-like blue hues.\r\n\r\nInterested in learning more about broken twill denim? Broken twill is a modification of the traditional twill weave. By altering the diagonal direction of the twill, broken twill creates a distinct zig-zag pattern. While aesthetically pleasing, this alteration also has a practical advantage\u2014it reduces the fabric's inherent tension, resulting in a softer fabric compared to its right-hand twill counterpart.

But it's more than just a wash\u2014it's a story. Hannes Levin, son of founders Maria and Joakim, and a stand-up guy who regularly lends a helping hand to us, once strolled in wearing a pair of worn-in Flare Glenn's. Those Glenn's blew our minds\u2014literally, we stood there in silence, all thinking the same thing: these are a piece of Nudie Jeans history, showcasing exactly why we do what we do. Hannes, sensing our awe, likely broke the somewhat odd silence with a humble \"What's up?\" and, well, he had to part with his jeans for a while.\n\nFast forward, and what you have before you is a meticulous recreation of Hannes' iconic jeans, featuring defined vertical slubbiness and a distinct crosshatch texture. The denim's hue leans towards a greenish-blue, while the abrasions tell their own story with a warmly dusty charm.\n\nHannes (and Maria and Joakim), we owe you big time for not just the style, but for the legacy you've bestowed upon us.

This orange-line selvage, exclusively woven for us, boasts a rigid-like texture with pronounced coarseness and a distinct 3-dimensional feel, accentuated by clear twill lines. The ring-spun warp and weft yarns offer moderate slubbiness, promising a distinct salt-and-pepper texture as the denim ages, and revealing clear twill lines in areas prone to abrasion.\r\n\r\nAchieved through 20 rounds of dip-dyeing in pure indigo, Kaihara's darkest and most saturated hue graces the warp yarns, the most important feature of the Dry Japan Selvage. This ensures that the warp yarns ages into clear, redcast, blue hues over time while maintaining contrast and depth in areas untouched by wear. Dry Japan Selvage has demonstrated exceptional aging qualities over the years, earning its place as one of our most cherished Japanese selvage denims, now available in Solid Ollie. Enjoy the journey!\r\n\r\nWe recommend a minimum of 6 months of daily wear before the first wash, although longer wear enhances the unique aging process. While it may seem lengthy, it's a suggestion; your jeans will acquire character with love and wear. Average emission of CO2 for producing this product.

Crafted from our \"Painter Denim,\" a deeply saturated pure indigo 2/1 denim, these pants are detailed with Nudie Jeans' signature orange thread and stainless steel \"Donut\" buttons. The result is a meticulously crafted, vintage-inspired denim with an expertly tailored fit, brought to life by the bold contrast of our signature orange thread. A thoughtful reinterpretation of traditional workwear, blending past influences with Nudie Jeans' aesthetic.\r\n\r\nCurious about \"Painter Denim\"? We're glad you asked. We spent years meticulously developing this fabric to achieve the authentic look and feel of classic 2/1 workwear denim. Made from irregular ring-spun yarns in both warp and weft, the warp is yarn-dyed in a deep, pure indigo, while the weft is yarn-dyed grey. Woven in a 2/1 Z construction, the fabric has a flatter surface compared to the more common 3/1 denim, giving it a uniform yet rich blue hue. Despite being a 2/1 weave, the fabric weighs in at 11.8 oz, providing a dense, rigid feel. This robust denim is built for durability and offers an exciting break-in journey. As it ages, the stiffness forms natural creases, while the irregular texture and deep indigo tones evolve, revealing beautiful highs and lows over time. The supplier and origin of raw material.

This 14.5 oz. denim boasts a tight weave density and generous starch application, ensuring remarkable rigidity. But what truly distinguishes it is its exceptional aging property, a testament to Kurabo Mills' blend of heritage and innovative denim craftsmanship.\r\n\r\nThis denim stands out due to its unique construction: the warp, visible predominantly on the fabric's face, is yarn-dyed black, allowing it to gradually fade with wear and washes. Conversely, the weft, visible on predominantly on the fabric's back, is dyed with a 'stay black' dye, retaining its deep black hue without fading. Although this might seem unconventional for fading denim, it yields intriguing contrasts, emphasizing the warp-weft intersections. This clever construction promises more pronounced contrasting fades compared to regular dry black denim.\r\n\r\nBeyond its unique yarn combination, the denim's tight weave, stiff texture, pronounced twill lines and slightly coarse yarns create an exquisite surface structure and marbling effects with wear and washes. \r\n\r\nFor optimal results, we recommend wearing our dry denim regularly for at least six months before the first wash. While entirely optional, this period encourages striking fades.  Average emission of CO2 for producing this product.

Weighing in at 12.75 oz. the denim is nicely coupled with Dean's slim fit. The starch in the denim gives it its crispy hand and, most importantly, generates pronounced creases on the jeans when worn - allowing for some contrasting moustaches and honeycombs. The denim itself is woven on old school shuttle looms with yarns that have been yarn dyed. The shuttle looms interlace the yarns into the selvage denim and the yarn dying keeps the core of the yarns white allowing the weave to fade beautifully - a slow process that reflects how denim was made back in the day. The finished denim has a clear twill structure which is nicely balanced by a slight slub character which with wear and washing will get more pronounced in a perfectly imperfect way. \r\n\r\nAs with all our dry denim we recommend at least 6 months of daily wear before the first wash to achieve contrasting fades.

At 15 oz., this denim is tightly woven from ring-spun warp and weft yarns, with nicely balanced yarn slub and yarn twist. This gives the fabric character in its raw stage, and it develops extremely satisfying highs and lows with washing. \r\n\r\nThe latter is made evident as the weft - the yarn system visible on the inside - is dyed in indanthrene black sulfur dye, a sulfur dye that does not fade from wearing or washing - stayblack. The warp, however, is dyed in regular sulfur, but only the surface yarns, which makes the black fade faster than normal. \r\n\r\nSo what you get is a pair of fast-fading black selvage jeans, which - thanks to that indanthrene-dyed weft - renders high contrasting fades.  We have treated these jeans to a rinse to increase the surface texture and give them a dull black tone. \r\n\r\nGiven their faster fading nature, we recommend that these jeans are washed with care, avoiding potential friction issues from machine washing. Holding off washing for the initial six months of regular wear is a good guideline. When washing is due, a gentle rinse is better than a full wash, reducing any unwanted wash effects. If machine washing is preferred, opt for a delicate cycle with low spin and swift removal afterwards. Dampening the jeans before washing helps soften them and minimizes potential issues.

Over thighs, knees, and back pockets soft, yet contrasting, wear-marks add highlights that give these jeans a washed-out and worn-in look. To us, there is something special with these grey hues of greatness. Average emission of CO2 for producing this product.

Our signature\u00a0all-cotton interlock\u00a0Serena fabric is more substantial than our Eterna or Pura fabrics. Its ingenuity is its ability to stretch without spandex. This is called mechanical stretch, achieved by the meticulously designed structure of the yarns. The fabric is washed\u00a0before\u00a0it's cut and sewn, an uncommon but very beneficial step. It minimizes shrinking over time (when following care instructions) and also prevents puckering and twisting around seams that often happens in your dryer when sewing threads shrink but fabric doesn't. Serena is used on many of our dresses, our all-cotton leggings, and in our most luxurious t-shirts. True investment-quality fabric! Why will your organic cotton clothing feel otherworldly soft right out of the bag and endure beautifully for years? Because we use the top 0.05% (not a typo) of cotton available. Softest and strongest aren't often used to describe a single fiber. Except when it's organic Peruvian Pima cotton. Ours is grown on two family farms and harvested with care by hand.

Soft, breathable, and built with natural stretch. Meet your new favorite cotton seamed leggings, now with pockets. This updated moto-style version of our best-selling all-cotton leggings features detailed top stitching, a wide waistband with elastic, and the comfort of organic Pima cotton. Soft, breathable, and built with natural stretch. As far as we're aware, Fair Indigo is the only place on earth where you can buy 100% cotton leggings. Bonus! Ours are made from the very best cotton on earth - organic Pima cotton from Peru.You will notice immediately that our leggings feel dreamy soft, and they do not cling like your typical synthetic leggings. Many customers choose to size down because our leggings have a looser fit.While our all-cotton leggings are not designed for intense athletic activity, they are perfect for your favorite low-impact sport and with proper care will endure beautifully. Why will your organic cotton leggings feel otherworldly soft right out of the bag and, with proper care, endure beautifully? Because we use the top 0.05% (not a typo) of cotton available. Softest and strongest aren't often used to describe a single fiber. Except when it's organic Peruvian Pima cotton. Ours is grown on two family farms and harvested with care by hand. Simply the best cotton you'll find anywhere on the planet. All of our dyes are certified to the most stringent safety standards such as the Oeko-tex 100 standard. They're tested for literally hundreds of dangerous substances like Azo colorants, formaldehyde, pentachlorophenol, cadmium, and nickel. Our dyes meet or exceed the US Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) regarding lead and the European Chemical Regulation (REACh). Often when apparel brands talk about sustainability, they are talking about making clothing that respects the environment and its limited resources - something to be applauded for sure. But at Fair Indigo, it also means sustainable lives for the world's garment workers. And a sustainable business model that prices clothing fairly, not too-good-to-be-true low (a signal the people were left out of the equation) nor artificially high to promote a future 70% off sale. It's time to move beyond fast fashion. For good. You've probably heard the expression 'less is more.' At Fair Indigo, we're inspired by the idea striving for LESS. A saner wardrobe that makes use of timeless 'forever in fashion' pieces you'll go back to time and again. That's why we build in quality - from the cotton and dyes we select to the extra processes we implement to create a garment you'll love for years. Buy better, buy less, live fully. In addition to living wage jobs, we believe the key to transforming communities from poverty to prosperity is education.

The plush organic cotton yarns strike the right balance between lightweight and cozy, giving you comfort without bulk. Effortless style meets everyday function. All Fair Indigo sweaters are fully fashioned, meaning each panel of the sweater is knit to fit the body by increasing or decreasing stitches to make the exact shapes and linking together the panels along the seams to complete the sweater. Fully fashioned sweaters have a better fit than lesser quality cut-and-sew sweaters. The fully fashioned process also eliminates unnecessary waste. You will notice a fully fashioned sweater by the little marks shown along the armholes as shown here. Cut-and-sew sweaters won't have these. Quality is in the details.

Often when apparel brands talk about sustainability, they are talking about making clothing that respects the environment and its limited resources - something to be applauded for sure. But at Fair Indigo, it also means sustainable lives for the world's garment workers.

        "sustainable - fairly made - forever in fashion free shipping every day Style: 03823 95% cotton 5% spandex fabric (see all in this fabric) 95% cotton 5% spandex fabric  Fair Indigo's organic cotton tees are 'better than anything you can find at the mall, no matter the price.' So says Bethanne in her review of the Long Sleeve V-neck Tee. We respectfully agree (and thanks Bethanne!). While many brands are ditching quality to play in the Fast Fashion lane and chase lower prices, we continue to build our tees up. Fair Indigo's organic cotton tees are 'better than anything you can find at the mall, no matter the price.' So says Bethanne in her review of the Long Sleeve V-neck Tee. We respectfully agree (and thanks Bethanne!). While many brands are ditching quality to play in the Fast Fashion lane and chase lower prices, we continue to build our tees up. Our knit stretch jersey Eterna fabric is so silky, smooth, and perfectly substantial without being too heavy. Just a hint of spandex adds incredible comfort and shape retention to your organic clothing. Our fabric starts with the best cotton on the planet, organic Peruvian Pima cotton. Its extra-long staple fibers produce fabrics that are not only silky smooth and soft, but also much stronger and longer lasting. Your organic tee will feel dreamy right out of the bag and endure beautifully for years with minimal shrinking and pilling. Why will your organic cotton t-shirt feel otherworldly soft right out of the bag and endure beautifully for years? Because we use the top 0.05% (not a typo) of cotton available. Softest and strongest aren't often used to describe a single fiber. Except when it's organic Peruvian Pima cotton. Ours is grown on two family farms and harvested with care by hand. Simply the best cotton you'll find anywhere on the planet. All of our dyes are certified to the most stringent safety standards such as the Oeko-tex 100 standard. They're tested for literally hundreds of dangerous substances like Azo colorants, formaldehyde, pentachlorophenol, cadmium, and nickel. Our dyes meet or exceed the US Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) regarding lead and the European Chemical Regulation (REACh). You've probably heard the expression 'less is more.' At Fair Indigo, we're inspired by the idea striving for LESS. A saner wardrobe that makes use of timeless 'forever in fashion' pieces you'll go back to time and again. That's why we build in quality - from the cotton and dyes we select to the extra processes we implement to create a garment you'll love for years. Buy better, buy less, live fully. Often when apparel brands talk about sustainability, they are talking about making clothing that respects the environment and its limited resources - something to be applauded for sure. But at Fair Indigo, it also means sustainable lives for the world's garment workers. And a sustainable business model that prices clothing fairly, not too-good-to-be-true low (a signal the people were left out of the equation) nor artificially high to promote a future 70% off sale. It's time to move beyond fast fashion. For good. In addition to living wage jobs, we believe the key to transforming communities from poverty to prosperity is education.  The Fair Indigo Foundation funds teachers' salaries, books, building improvements, and computer labs for children who otherwise were being left behind.

At Fair Indigo, we're inspired by the idea striving for LESS. A saner wardrobe that makes use of timeless 'forever in fashion' pieces you'll go back to time and again. That's why we build in quality - from the cotton and dyes we select to the extra processes we implement to create a garment you'll love for years. Buy better, buy less, live fully. Often when apparel brands talk about sustainability, they are talking about making clothing that respects the environment and its limited resources - something to be applauded for sure. But at Fair Indigo, it also means sustainable lives for the world's garment workers. And a sustainable business model that prices clothing fairly, not too-good-to-be-true low (a signal the people were left out of the equation) nor artificially high to promote a future 70% off sale.

A shopper from Maryland says,\u00a0\"I have this in seven colors.This scarf is perfect in every way.\"\u00a0 We're confident you'll agree. Its genuine heirloom quality only elevates its place as one of your Forever in Fashion essentials. Gorgeously soft, wonderfully warm, and an instant way to add flair to your winter outfit, the Baby Alpaca Scarf is a humane alternative to factory farm cashmere. A shopper from Maryland says,\u00a0\"I have this in seven colors.This scarf is perfect in every way.\"\u00a0 We're confident you'll agree. Its genuine heirloom quality only elevates its place as one of your Forever in Fashion essentials. Nestled in the Peruvian Andes, alpaca ranchers have been deriving their livelihoods and supplying the world with one of its the most beautiful fibers since the time of the Incas. Baby alpaca refers not to the age (no babies involved!) but to the fleece obtained from the softest part of the animal's underbelly where the fibers are superfine (22-23 microns). The benefits of baby alpaca are many: The color of alpaca fleece gorgeously spans from a dark chocolate tone to almost white. The scarves pictured here use only these naturally occuring colors, no dyes.   Just look for \"Undyed\" in the color name above. Yes, baby alpaca itself connotes the very best quality. But that's just the start. Our artisans meticulously craft each garment to exactly consistency and sewing standards.   Pictured here is a beautiful tool derived from the cabuya plant, native to the Andes: ideal for removing stray threads from our finished garments.  Often when apparel brands talk about sustainability, they are talking about making clothing that respects the environment and its limited resources - something to be applauded for sure. But at Fair Indigo, it also means sustainable lives for the world's garment workers. Our alpaca facility is a model for fair trade. Immaculate working conditions, wages far above legal minimums, and on-site benefits like a health clinic, worker-owned cooperative grocery store, and a team of professional chefs that prepare delicious Peruvian meals for our team.

And a sustainable business model that prices clothing fairly, not too-good-to-be-true low (a signal the people were left out of the equation) nor artificially high to promote a future 70% off sale. It's time to move beyond fast fashion. For good. You've probably heard the expression 'less is more.' At Fair Indigo, we're inspired by the idea striving for LESS. A saner wardrobe that makes use of timeless 'forever in fashion' pieces you'll go back to time and again. That's why we build in quality - from the cotton and dyes we select to the extra processes we implement to create a garment you'll love for years. Buy better, buy less, live fully. In addition to living wage jobs, we believe the key to transforming communities from poverty to prosperity is education.  The Fair Indigo Foundation funds teachers' salaries, books, building improvements, and computer labs for children who otherwise were being left behind.

        "sustainable - fairly made - forever in fashion free shipping every day Style: 04470 95% cotton 5% spandex fabric (see all in this fabric) 95% cotton 5% spandex fabric  Emphatically not your boyfriend's henley; you'll want to wear this long sleeve henley every day. The 5-button placket, contrast raglan sleeves, and softly finished neckline elevate it to anything but ordinary. Emphatically not your boyfriend's henley; you'll want to wear this long sleeve henley every day. The 5-button placket, contrast raglan sleeves, and softly finished neckline elevate it to anything but ordinary. Our knit stretch jersey Eterna fabric is so silky, smooth, and perfectly substantial without being too heavy. Just a hint of spandex adds incredible comfort and shape retention to your organic clothing. Our fabric starts with the best cotton on the planet, organic Peruvian Pima cotton. Its extra-long staple fibers produce fabrics that are not only silky smooth and soft, but also much stronger and longer lasting. Your organic tee will feel dreamy right out of the bag and endure beautifully for years with minimal shrinking and pilling. Why will your organic cotton t-shirt feel otherworldly soft right out of the bag and endure beautifully for years? Because we use the top 0.05% (not a typo) of cotton available. Softest and strongest aren't often used to describe a single fiber. Except when it's organic Peruvian Pima cotton. Ours is grown on two family farms and harvested with care by hand. Simply the best cotton you'll find anywhere on the planet. All of our dyes are certified to the most stringent safety standards such as the Oeko-tex 100 standard. They're tested for literally hundreds of dangerous substances like Azo colorants, formaldehyde, pentachlorophenol, cadmium, and nickel. Our dyes meet or exceed the US Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) regarding lead and the European Chemical Regulation (REACh). You've probably heard the expression 'less is more.'

Your input is very much appreciated. Share it with your friends so they can enjoy it too! Well made, soft, tightly knit cotton, preshrunk. Love the color palate. I bought two and live how versatile and well made the pieces are. Will be going back for more. This tie dye pattern was part of their first signature collection and still remains my favorite! I love the colors, pattern and hue. It's super light to throw over any outfit to add a pop of color. I carry it around in my purse in case I need an extra layer. This cardigan with the matching skirt and their plain white Jane tank was my summer staple. No wonder this set sold out so fast the first time around! Even though it is somewhat short, I also like that I'm able to wear it tied up in the front. I'm 5'5'' and wearing an XS in the photo. Very cute, fun shape, soft material, doesn't wrinkle easily. A tad snug on the biceps, I probably should have sized up to a medium. (140, 5'6\" athletic) I had to wait a little while due to production issues, but I was kept well aware of the progress and was offered an opportunity to cancel. So glad I waited! Lovely lil cardigan in happy colors made in soft fabric. I\u2019ve since ordered 3 more items from YesAnd.\r\n I bought this cardigan, the matching sweatshirt and slim joggers. They are high quality, look great and the %100 cotton feels great. I bought the small joggers and they were too small. The return process was easy and in less than 1 week I am wearing the medium which fit great. This is a great look cardigan.

I ordered these pants in black, and my favorite detail of the pants were the pocket that reads, \u201cLive The Earth\u201d but when I received the pants there is nothing on the pocket. Disappointed ):\r\n The pants are exactly what I was looking for- a stylish, very high waisted pant that I can wear both around the house and to work. I am about 5'7 and 115 lbs and a size S fits great. The waistband is tighter than I expected, which makes it a bit hard to get over my hips but once they are on they are comfortable.

I knew that the tie dye pattern would be different than pictured because they\u2019re done by hand, but I wish mine would have had as much white space as the model\u2019s piece.

Shop the Earth Month Discounts tab April 09, 2021 1\u00a0 \u00a0(acronym) Global Organic Textile Standard: \"the world's leading processing standard for textiles made from organic fibers. It defines high-level environmental criteria along the entire organic textiles supply chain and requires compliance with social criteria as well.\"  What in GOTS name does GOTS-certified mean, anyway?\u00a0 Our founder was actually part of the group of experts that helped to establish the Global Organic Textile Standard. A finished textile must be made up of at least 70% organic fiber to be GOTS-certified.\u00a0What makes GOTS so special is that is does not ONLY require the usage of organic fiber, it goes above and beyond to encourage makers to meet a number of criteria throughout the supply chain. This means that dyes must be free of thousands of toxic chemicals, wastewater must be treated properly, workers must receive a living wage and\u00a0factories must meet stringent safety standards.\u00a0 Gaining GOTS certification for textile products is not easy, but it's worth it. Just like shopping for organic produce with the USDA organic seal, the GOTS seal can reassure you that what you're choosing to wear is not harmful to you, the environment, or the growers and sewers along the way. Still confused? Here are some more resources to help understand GOTS!

        "\ud83c\udf0e Earth Month Specials: 60% OFF weekly selects! Shop the Earth Month Discounts tab March 05, 2020 YES, fashion is fun\u2026 AND it has a deeper purpose. We have so much power to change the world simply by making informed decisions on what we wear. Usually when we think of the word \u201csustainability,\u201d we think of climate change and water use. This International Women\u2019s Day, we are going deeper by looking at how our business decisions narrow the gender gap. 1\u00a0\u00a0There are more female leaders in sustainable fashion. \u201cOnly 14% of major mainstream brands have a female executive in charge,\u201d according to a 2018 McKinsey study, Shattering the Glass Runway. But if you look at the top players in sustainable apparel-- Eileen Fisher, Patagonia, and Reformation\u2026 women lead the way. Overall, the playing field is more level in businesses that make sustainability a priority because gender equality is part of being a responsible business.\u00a0 2\u00a0\u00a0Because women make up nearly 80% of the fashion industry\u2019s workforce, making positive changes to the way we do business disproportionately lifts women. For instance, if we choose to use certified organic cotton, the reduced exposure to toxins improves the health of everyone in the majority-female supply chain. Women\u2019s issues are often framed in a way that highlights that fast fashion is bad for women (which is true) but at YES AND, we prefer to stay focused on solutions. We are all interconnected-- when we lift one piece of the web that ties us all together, we are all lifted.  3\u00a0\u00a0Sustainable fashion de-objectifies women. Through the lens of global consciousness, sustainable fashion is a vehicle for empowerment and industry transformation. Conventional fashion, on the other hand, targets women. For decades, women have been made to feel inadequate in their physical appearance so that large corporations could capitalize off of our insecurity. As a result, we spend three times more on clothing, most of which ends up in the pockets of men. From the farm to the boardroom to our closets, supporting sustainable brands means supporting women, all over the world. Happy Women\u2019s History Month and International Women\u2019s Day!

        "\ud83c\udf0e Earth Month Specials: 60% OFF weekly selects! Shop the Earth Month Discounts tab October 18, 2021 blockchain\u00a0(n.) - a central, secure place for connecting info, documents, data and suppliers. A tool for traceability, transparency and efficiencies for supply chains. Some\u00a0of the core pillars of\u00a0the YesAnd brand\u00a0are\u00a0authenticity, traceability, transparency and innovation. Why? We know that the future of fashion relies on both trust and technology.\u00a0Everyone should be\u00a0clear on where we stand on our sustainability journey, every step of the way.\u00a0With a global supply chain, our team needs to be connected throughout, and it's in our brand ethos to allow access to that journey.\u00a0 It's no secret that fashion's supply chains are fraught with exploitation, corruption, and environmental destruction.\u00a0But, at YesAnd, we\u00a0believe the industry can transform into one\u00a0that empowers, regenerates, and restores both people and planet. After all, a garment can change hands 7-10 times or more before it reaches the \"end consumer.\" 80% of supply chains are terribly fragmented-- expanding networks of suppliers and their many subcontractors spiraling beyond even the most diligent brand's possible supervision. We aim to empower everyone along our vertical supply chains. Blockchain helps digitize the steps in our manufacturing process, giving us the ability to\u00a0track and trace our materials from farm to finished product. This data is collected in one place so we can\u00a0benchmark, audit, and continue to improve. Because all info is embedded in the blockchain, it adds an extra layer of authenticity\u00a0by offering visibility at every stage of the supply chain, not to mention validating our certifications at each of those stages. Just like we\u2019ve grown closer to the sources of our food, blockchain gives customers the chance to get closer to understanding how and where our products are made. Our goal is to get our entire supply chain\u00a0connected on blockchain. Right now,\u00a0we have our largest knits factory plugged in. We\u00a0are aiming to transition the rest of our factories as soon as possible. Step two will be to embed impact metrics-- that is, tracking carbon impact, energy and water usage throughout each of the stages. Our blockchain is powered by the credible, storytelling interface, Storybird. By scanning the QR code on the inside tag of our newest styles from our blockchain-enabled factories, you are invited to join us on the journey to the origin of your favorite YesAnd pieces.

We may earn a commission on purchases, at no additional cost to you. Learn more \u2192 Are you concerned about the invisible toxins lurking in your home? I certainly was when I became a parent. That \"fresh\" smell after cleaning or unpacking new furniture? It's actually a cocktail of chemicals that could be harming your family's health. We spend nearly 90% of our time indoors, where pollutant levels can be 2-5 times higher than outside. This is due to the use of harsh chemicals in synthetic cleaners, materials, and poor ventilation. Many of these substances \u2013 from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) off-gassed by furniture to hormone-disrupting chemicals in plastics \u2013 have been linked to health issues like asthma, allergies, and even cancer . The good news is you can significantly improve your home\u2019s health and can drastically reduce exposure to these harmful chemicals by making non-toxic swaps in key areas, benefiting your whole family, especially little ones who are extra-sensitive to toxins. Begin with one room or category at a time to prevent feeling overwhelmed. Vinegar, baking soda, and essential oils can replace most commercial cleaners. Focus first on items used daily and products for children who are more sensitive to toxins. We spend 90% of time indoors where pollutant levels can be 2-5\u00d7 higher than outdoors. You don't need to replace everything at once \u2014 each change makes a positive impact. Look for GOTS, GOLS, Oeko-Tex, and GreenGuard Gold certifications when shopping. Removing toxins from your home starts with identifying harmful ingredients and toxic chemicals in everyday items\u2014everything from cleaning products and personal care items to cookware and furniture. Focus on simple swaps to reduce toxins room by room. For instance, try diy cleaning solutions made with baking soda, white vinegar, and a few drops of essential oils. Swap plastic containers for glass food storage to avoid chemical leaching. Opt for stainless steel pots and cast iron instead of non stick cookware with questionable non stick coatings. By tackling one area at a time, you\u2019ll transform your entire house into a non toxic home that supports your family\u2019s well being. Below are my top 11 easy-to-follow swaps for a safer, healthier home\u2014practical tips I\u2019ve personally found make a huge difference.  Did you know many cleaning supplies contain ammonia, chlorine, and phthalates that irritate your skin and lungs? Instead of dousing your home in these toxins and synthetic fragrances, switch to natural cleaning remedies with nontoxic ingredients. Simple items you already smell amazing and work wonders to cut grease and grime from your kitchen sink to your bathroom tub! Non Toxic Swaps: Use vinegar and water (50/50) for windows and mirrors. Baking soda tackles tubs and sinks gently but effectively. Use DIY all purpose cleaner made with castile soap, white vinegar, and a few drops of essential oils like lemon or lavender. Swap toxic dish soap with eco friendly, fragrance free formulas For hand soap, select nontoxic products labeled \u201cfree & clear\u201d of synthetic fragrances. Trusted natural brands: Branch Basics*, Dr. Bronner\u2019s*, Sonett* , that avoid chlorine, artificial fragrance, and VOCs \u2013 look for products with the EPA Safer Choice label The benefits of these non toxic lifestyle swaps include improved indoor air quality (no more chemical odors or headaches) and a safer environment for children and pets. Plus, DYI cleaning solutions are often budget-friendly \u2013 baking soda, vinegar, lemon, and castile soap can handle most household chores at a fraction of the cost!  The safety of your kitchenware is vital for maintaining a healthy home environment. Recent scientific studies have highlighted potential health risks associated with toxic chemicals from certain cookware and food storage materials. Nonstick cookware and non stick pans with Teflon (PTFE) coatings can release PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d at high heat, which are linked to cancers and hormone disruption. Aluminum cookware can leach metals if not coated. Plastic containers, especially those made from polycarbonate (marked with recycling code #7), can leach chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA) into food, particularly when heated . Even BPA-free plastics may release other concerning compounds over time. Swap these out for inert, time-tested materials! Opt for cast iron, stainless steel, or pure ceramic-coated pans (labeled PFAS-free). Stainless steel pots and cast iron skillets are healthier alternatives, and a cast iron pan can develop a natural nonstick layer over time. If you use an air fryer, look for one with a stainless steel or ceramic basket instead of traditional non stick coatings to avoid toxic fumes at high temperatures. For bakeware, choose glass containers or ceramic over non-stick sheets. Glass food storage or stainless steel containers instead of plastic for leftovers. For healthy food prep, consider using wooden spoons instead of plastic utensils to avoid microplastics. For babies, glass bottles with medical-grade silicone nipples are safest. Additional Kitchenware Considerations: Cooking Utensils: Replace plastic cooking utensils, which can melt or shed microplastics, with wooden or silicone alternatives. Cutting Boards: Opt for bamboo or wooden cutting boards instead of plastic. Bamboo is naturally antimicrobial and avoids the issue of plastic shavings that can occur with plastic boards.  We absorb many chemicals through our skin, so what you put on your body is as important as what you put in it. Conventional skincare, cosmetics, and hygiene products often contain a cocktail of problematic ingredients: parabens(preservatives that can mimic estrogen), phthalates (in synthetic fragrance, linked to hormone disruption), formaldehyde-releasing agents (preservatives like quaternium-15), triclosan (antibacterial in soaps, linked to hormone issues and antibiotic resistance), and sulfates like SLS (a harsh detergent) . These have been associated with everything from skin irritation to endocrine (hormone) disruption. Non Toxic Swaps: Choose clearly labeled \"paraben-free, phthalate-free, sulfate-free, fragrance-free\" products. Brands I trust: Weleda*, Primally Pure*, and 100% Pure* Easy DIY alternatives: homemade sugar scrubs or whipped coconut oil and shea butter moisturizers. If you see vague \u201cfragrance\u201d on an ingredient list, that could hide dozens of chemicals (including phthalates) \u2013 instead, opt for products scented only with natural essential oils or go unscented . Use products with natural preservatives like vitamin E or rosemary extract instead of parabens . For example, you can swap a conventional lotion containing parabens for one made with organic oils and preserved with vitamin E \u2013 same moisturizing benefit without the hormone hit. Replace sulfate-heavy shampoos with ones using gentler plant-based surfactants (like coco-glucoside) to avoid scalp and skin irritation . Choose an aluminum-free deodorant (many use baking soda or magnesium hydroxide to neutralize odor) to avoid the parabens and triclosan in many antiperspirants.  Your fresh laundry shouldn\u2019t come with a side of toxins. Yet many conventional laundry detergents, fabric softeners, and dryer sheets deposit a layer of chemicals onto clothes. The biggest culprits are synthetic fragrances and harsh additives. That \u201cspring breeze\u201d scent in detergents and softeners is typically a mix of dozens of chemicals, including potential allergens and phthalates (which help scents last). Studies have found that scented laundry products can emit hazardous air pollutants like acetaldehyde and even benzene when used. Fabric softeners often contain phthalates (for scent) and synthetic musks like galaxolide that accumulate in our bodies , as well as quaternary ammonium compounds that can cause skin irritation or asthma. Colored detergents may have artificial dyes (e.g. D&C violet #2) linked to cancer . Non Toxic Swaps: Fragrance-free detergents (e.g., .Branch Basics, NaturOli, Molly's Suds) White vinegar instead of fabric softener (ry adding 1/2 cup of distilled white vinegar ) Wool dryer balls instead of dryer sheets. DIY cleaning solutions for laundry powder (washing soda, baking soda, grated castile soap). Look for detergents labeled \u201cFree & Clear\u201d \u2013 meaning no synthetic fragrance or dyes. You can even try soap nuts or DIY laundry powder (mixing washing soda, baking soda, and grated castile soap) as a natural detergent. By making these swaps, you avoid exposing your family to the \u201cmystery cocktail\u201d of fragrance chemicals and irritants in typical laundry products . You\u2019ll still get fresh, clean clothes. And an added bonus: natural laundry routines are often more eco-friendly (phosphate-free, biodegradable) and can extend the life of your fabrics by treating them more gently.  Everyone wants a good-smelling home, but ironically, many air fresheners and scented candles pollute your indoor air. That \u201cclean linen\u201d spray or plug-in emits VOCs like acetone, chloroform, and limonene, and studies show air fresheners can produce formaldehyde and other carcinogens as they react in air . A University of Washington study found that 5 out of 6 top-selling air fresheners emitted at least one chemical classified as toxic or hazardous \u2013 yet none of those were disclosed on the labels. Scented candles made of paraffin wax (a petroleum byproduct) release soot and compounds such as toluene and benzene when burned, which are linked to cancer and respiratory issues. They also often contain synthetic fragrance and sometimes metal in wicks. Over time, using these products can contribute to headaches, allergies, or irritation for many people. Instead of chemical-laden sprays and paraffin candles, freshen your home the natural way. Non Toxic Swaps: Ventilate daily by opening windows. Use essential oil diffusers for safe fragrance. A few drops of pure essential oils (like lavender, peppermint, or citrus) in a diffuser or nebulizer can scent a room with no synthetic chemicals. You can also create your own room spray with water + a bit of vodka + essential oils If you love candles, choose ones made from 100% soy or beeswax, or coconut wax with cotton wicks. These burn much cleaner \u2013 soy candles produce far less soot and toxins than paraffin , and\u00a0beeswax candles even emit negative ions that can help neutralize pollutants. Just be sure any added fragrance in natural candles is from essential oils or plant-based sources. Many artisans make non-toxic candles (look for labels like phthalate-free, paraffin-free). Beeswax candles have a mild honey scent on their own and no additives. Rather than masking odors, address them at the source. For example, baking soda is excellent for absorbing odors in carpets or the fridge \u2013 sprinkle it, let it sit, then vacuum or wipe up. Activated charcoal (in small bags or briquettes) can absorb smells and VOCs in the air. Houseplants are often touted for air purification \u2013 while plants do absorb some VOCs like formaldehyde, you\u2019d need a jungle of them to significantly clean a whole house . Still, a few hardy plants (snake plant, spider plant, pothos) can slightly improve air and add ambiance, just don\u2019t rely on them alone. For serious air cleaning, consider an air purifier with a HEPA filter (captures particles like dust, pollen) and an activated carbon filter (absorbs VOCs and odors). This can be especially helpful if you\u2019re eliminating fragranced products and want to clear out residual odors or if you have allergies. Also, avoid mothballs for closets (they contain the pesticides naphthalene or paradichlorobenzene which are harmful to breathe); instead protect clothes naturally with cedar blocks or lavender sachets to repel moths. These swaps transformed our home's air\u2014freshness without headaches or respiratory concerns.  Clean water is fundamental to health, yet tap water can contain a mix of contaminants. Since 2019, over 320 toxic substances have been detected in U.S. drinking water systems \u2013 including lead from old pipes, agricultural pesticides, industrial chemicals, and the now-infamous PFAS chemicals. These harsh chemicals are linked to cancer, developmental issues, and other serious health problems. Municipal water is treated to remove microbes, typically with chlorine or chloramine, which leaves residues and can form byproducts like chloroform (a probable carcinogen). Filtering your water is an essential swap for a healthier home, both for the water you drink and the water you shower in. While we don\u2019t drink shower water, hot showers can cause chlorine and other chemicals to vaporize, and your skin can absorb substances too. Showering in chlorinated water can expose you to inhaling chloroform and other byproducts \u2013 one study suggested shower inhalation might contribute significantly to chloroform exposure in homes . Non Toxic Swaps: Reverse osmosis (RO) systems effectively purify drinking water. At minimum, use a filter with activated carbon, which is effective at reducing chlorine, disinfection byproducts, and many organic chemicals. Quality NSF-certified pitcher filters as affordable alternatives. The Environmental Working Group\u2019s water database can tell you what\u2019s in your local tap and suggest filter types . Showerhead filters that contains carbon or KDF media reduce chlorine exposure (and some can reduce other impurities). Additionally, if you have an infant and use tap water to mix formula, filtering is critical \u2013 for instance, the American Dental Association even recommends using low-fluoride water for babies to avoid fluorosis . Overall, the water swap is about purity: by taking control of water quality at the tap, you remove the last line of pollutants that municipal treatment and building pipes might leave behind.  Your furniture and home finishes (paint, flooring, etc.) might be quietly off-gassing chemicals into your home\u2019s air. New furniture (especially if it\u2019s made from pressed wood/particleboard or synthetic foam) often releases formaldehyde and other VOCs \u2013 that \u201cnew furniture smell\u201d is actually chemical off-gassing . Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen and can cause headaches, throat irritation, and asthma attacks. It\u2019s commonly used in the glues and resins for plywood, MDF, and furniture upholstery. One article notes formaldehyde is \u201cused extensively in modern furniture materials\u201d like MDF and adhesives . Over time the emissions taper off, but it can take months or years for a piece to fully off-gas. Additionally, sofas and chairs have historically been treated with flame-retardant chemicals (like PBDEs or newer replacements) in their foam to meet fire safety laws. These chemicals can migrate into dust and have been linked to hormone disruption and neurological effects. Paints, varnishes, and flooring adhesives are another source of VOCs (toluene, xylene, etc.), which contribute to indoor air pollution. Non Toxic Swaps: Solid wood furniture or low-VOC certified options (GreenGuard Gold, CARB Phase 2 compliant). Zero-VOC paints for home decor. When buying new furniture or remodeling, look for products labeled low-VOC or VOC-free. For wood furniture, the best choice is solid wood (e.g. solid hardwood tables, dressers) with non-toxic finishes. Solid wood pieces (or metal, or glass furniture) generally emit far fewer chemicals than pressed-wood products.  If you do buy engineered wood, choose those that meet strict formaldehyde standards \u2013 e.g., labeled CARB Phase 2 compliant or TSCA Title VI compliant. Some companies use NAF (no-added-formaldehyde) resins or ULEF (ultra-low emitting formaldehyde) \u2013 those are good keywords to watch for . Also, look for furniture and materials with GreenGuard Gold certification, which means they have been tested for chemical emissions and certified to emit very low levels of VOCs . Choosing natural materials pays off: e.g., a couch made with a solid wood frame, natural latex or CertiPUR-certified foam (low VOC), and organic cotton or linen upholstery will release far fewer toxins than a conventional couch made with particleboard frame and chemical-treated foam. If replacing furniture isn\u2019t an option immediately, you can reduce emissions from what you have: ensure good ventilation (especially when furniture is new \u2013 open windows, use fans), and consider using VOC-absorbing plants or activated charcoal around the area. There are even sealant products you can paint onto furniture or plywood to lock in formaldehyde (these can be useful for things like the interior of particleboard cabinets \u2013 essentially creating a barrier so they off-gas less into the room). For paints and finishes in the home, opt for low-VOC or zero-VOC paints (widely available now from major brands). Conventional paints and polyurethane varnishes can off-gas for weeks; low-VOC paints have minimal smell and health impact, making it safer to paint without evacuating the house. If you install new carpet, look for \u201cgreen label\u201d low-emission carpet and air it out extensively, or choose area rugs made of wool or cotton instead of wall-to-wall synthetics. By swapping to furniture and materials with low or no VOC content, you reduce the risk of headaches, allergies, or more serious health effects from chronic VOC exposure . This is especially important for kids \u2013 their smaller bodies and developing systems make them more vulnerable to fumes. A low-toxicity home (often called a \u201cgreen\u201d or healthy home) might include, for instance, a dining table made of reclaimed wood and finished with beeswax oil, a sofa from a sustainable brand that avoids flame retardants, organic cotton curtains instead of PVC blinds, and VOC-free paint in all the rooms. Each of those choices contributes to cleaner air and a safer haven. And an often-overlooked bonus: natural furniture and materials can be higher quality and more durable, since you\u2019re often choosing solid craftsmanship over cheap composite materials. So you\u2019re investing in pieces that last, which is both economically and environmentally beneficial. We spend about one-third of our lives in bed, so your mattress and bedding should be toxin-free, it is crucial. Traditional mattresses can be a major source of chemical exposure: many are made with polyurethane foam (which can emit VOCs, sometimes called a \u201cfoam smell\u201d or chemical odor) and are treated with flame retardant chemicals to meet flammability regulations . Older mattresses often had PBDE flame retardants (now banned for toxicity) and newer ones might contain chemicalslike antimony trioxide (a flame retardant linked to cancer) or fiberglass fire barriers . These substances can leach out: fiberglass shards from some mattress covers have caused household contamination, and chemical flame retardants can migrate into your bedroom dust. Additionally, mattresses with vinyl covers (common in crib mattresses or waterproof protectors) can off-gas phthalatesor PVC chemicals that may affect development. Bedding can also be an issue: wrinkle-resistant sheets are treated with formaldehyde (as discussed above), and some cheap textiles contain residues of dyes or finishes that could irritate skin. Non Toxic Swaps: Organic mattresses made with latex, cotton, or wool, free from flame retardants and VOCs. Organic or Oeko-Tex certified sheets and pillows. When it\u2019s time for a new mattress, seek out organic or natural material mattresses. These use components like natural latex rubber (from rubber tree sap) instead of polyurethane foam, organic cotton or wool batting instead of polyester, and avoid chemical flame retardants by design. Wool is a natural flame retardant, so many organic mattresses use a wool layer to meet fire codes without adding chemicals. Look for certifications such as GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) for the cotton/wool and GOLS (Global Organic Latex Standard) for latex \u2013 these ensure the materials are truly organic and also restrict harmful additives. Another certification to look for is CertiPUR-US for foam; CertiPUR-US certified foams are at least made with lower VOC emissions and without certain toxic flame retardants or heavy metals. For example, an EWG-verified mattress or a GOTS-certified organic cotton futon will have 95%+ organic content, no added flame retardants, and very low VOC levels. Several brands specialize in non-toxic mattresses (such as Naturepedic, Avocado, etc.), offering options from crib size to king. If a fully organic mattress is out of budget, even opting for a \u201chybrid\u201d mattress with a pocket-coil spring core and a CertiPUR-US foam comfort layer will reduce some foam volume and often have less off-gassing than an all-foam bed. Always open a new mattress in a well-ventilated area and let it air out for a few days if possible. All these swaps lead to a cooler, cleaner, and more comfortable night\u2019s rest without your body being a sponge for industrial chemicals overnight.  Babies and children are especially vulnerable to toxins, making non-toxic swaps in their gear and toys crucial. Historically, baby products contained harmful chemicals, such as BPA (bisphenol A) in older plastic bottles and phthalates in soft vinyl toys, both linked to hormonal and developmental issues. Flame retardants, previously common in pajamas and still used in car seats and crib mattresses, are another area of concern. Non Toxic Swaps: Swap plastic bottles for glass ones with silicone sleeves\u2014these are non-toxic and durable. Stainless steel bottles with silicone nipples are another safe, unbreakable option. For teethers, opt for silicone or natural rubber from reputable brands. Replace plastic toddler cups and plates with stainless steel, tempered glass. Wooden toys with non-toxic finishes and medical-grade silicone options. Avoid vinyl bath toys; instead, select PVC-free or silicone alternatives. Organic cotton or Oeko-Tex-certified stuffed animals are ideal. Choose natural-material toys like wooden or sustainably sourced rubberwood, finished with non-toxic paints. Choose chlorine-free diapers (unbleached or oxygen-bleached) without fragrances, phthalates, or dyes. For wipes, fragrance-free or reusable cloth wipes with water are the safest choices Snug-fitting cotton pajamas for children avoid flame retardant treatments Select BPA-free and PVC-free products for strollers, high chairs, and play mats. Opt for PE-covered play mats or, even better, organic cotton mats or blankets to avoid foam off-gassing. By making these non-toxic swaps, you create a cleaner, safer environment for your child. This approach reduces exposure to harmful chemicals, lowers the risk of developmental issues and allergies, and provides peace of mind. Simplifying with fewer, high-quality, non-toxic products can also reduce clutter and encourage creative play\u2014a wonderful bonus of embracing a toxin-free lifestyle.  \u00a9 Sophie Kr\u00f6her The clothes we wear can be a hidden source of chemical exposure. Conventional cotton, one of the most pesticide-intensive crops, often leaves residues in finished garments. Additionally, textiles frequently undergo chemical treatments like formaldehyde resins for wrinkle resistance, perfluorinated chemicals (PFAS) for stain or water resistance, flame retardants, and potentially harmful dyes. A 2022 analysis found 75% of stain- or water-resistant textiles tested contained PFAS chemicals . PFAS on clothing(like waterproof jackets) can rub off on your hands and gradually wear off into your environment. Non Toxic Swaps Choose organic or untreated natural fiber clothing when possible. Organic cotton ensures no synthetic pesticides or harsh chemicals were used in production. If organic isn\u2019t available, look for Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certification, confirming the clothing is tested for harmful substances such as formaldehyde, azo dyes, and nickel. Bamboo viscose (from reputable brands), hemp, and linen are other eco-friendly fabrics worth considering. Avoid clothing labeled \"antibacterial\" or \"odor-fighting,\" as these often contain antimicrobial chemicals like silver nanoparticles or triclosan, unnecessary for daily wear and harmful to the environment. Similarly, avoid \"stain-resistant\" or \"water-repellent\" fabrics unless explicitly labeled PFAS-free, as many such fabrics still contain these harmful chemicals. Opt instead for clothing from brands using safer alternatives like silicone or polyurethane coatings for water resistance. Always wash new clothing before first use to remove surface chemicals, excess dye, and finishing agents. Using fragrance-free detergents and adding a cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle helps eliminate residues, reducing the risk of irritation and allergic reactions. Children\u2019s sleepwear (above size 9 months in the U.S.) is required to be flame-resistant or snug-fitting. Opt for snug-fitting cotton pajamas labeled as \"wear snug-fitting, not flame resistant,\" as these do not contain flame retardants. Avoid loose-fitting, flame-resistant polyester pajamas, which might contain alternative flame retardant chemicals. Be cautious with furniture upholstery and curtains labeled as flame-retardant; consider untreated replacements or organic cotton slipcovers to minimize exposure. Traditional dry cleaning uses perchloroethylene (perc), a probable carcinogen and VOC. Safer alternatives include \"wet cleaning\" or CO2 cleaning services, which avoid harmful chemicals. If you must use traditional dry cleaning, air out clothes outdoors before bringing them indoors. By selecting organic or minimally-treated fabrics, you reduce chemical exposure and skin irritation. Even small changes\u2014such as switching underwear, bedsheets, and kids\u2019 pajamas\u2014can significantly decrease your family\u2019s contact with harmful substances. Over time, you'll build a wardrobe of comfortable, stylish, and safer clothing, beneficial to both your health and the environment.  Identify & Replace: Look for harmful ingredients in cleaning products, personal care, and home goods, then swap them for healthier alternatives (e.g., non toxic dish soap, fragrance free laundry detergent, cast iron or stainless steel cookware). Filter Air & Water: Use HEPA air purifiers, ventilate daily, and invest in filtered water (RO or carbon) to remove harmful chemicals like chlorine byproducts and PFAS. Go Natural: Simple swaps (like baking soda, white vinegar, and a few drops of essential oils) can replace harsh chemicals. Look for nontoxic ingredients in all purpose cleaner, hand soap, and dish soap. Choose Safer Materials: Opt for solid wood or GreenGuard Gold furniture, organic mattresses, low-VOC paints, and bpa free or glass containers. Avoid non stick cookware and traditional candles made with paraffin wax. Think Long-Term: Switching to a non toxic or non toxic living mindset improves your family\u2019s well being over time. Tackle your entire house in steps, focusing on one room at a time.  Making these non toxic swaps step by step transformed my family\u2019s health and how I feel about our non toxic home. Each small change significantly improves air quality, reduces chemical leaching, and supports overall well being. Remember, you don\u2019t have to do everything at once. Choose one or two areas to start, and gradually you\u2019ll create a safer, healthier space for your entire family. Investing in non toxic living now reaps long-term benefits for happiness and well-being.

Fragrances are everywhere - in your perfume, body lotion, but also laundry detergents, air fresheners and other scented products - but not all scents are created equal. Fragrance can either be synthetic or natural - but which is better? The answer isn't as straightforward as you might think. Many of us want products that are gentle on skin, good for the environment, and that smell incredible. But the conversation around synthetic fragrance vs natural fragrance is more than just a preference for \"clean beauty\" or \"longer-lasting scents\", and can feel daunting if you\u2019re not up to speed on the science. In this article, I\u2019ll walk you through both sides\u2014sharing personal insights, essential facts, health risks, and the latest industry research. My hope is that by the end, you\u2019ll feel much more confident about the fragrances you bring into your life (and home). Let\u2019s dive in together!  Fragrance has played an important role into human culture for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians used scented oils and incense in rituals, while the Greeks and Romans prized natural perfumes made from flowers and spices for their beauty and supposed healing properties. Fast-forward to the late 19th century, and everything changed with synthetic fragrance breakthroughs. Chemists discovered how to isolate or even invent aroma compounds, resulting in more affordable and reliable scent experiences for all of us. So, instead of depending solely on fields of roses, manufacturers could replicate that lovely floral note in labs whenever needed. Today, most of what we call \u2018perfume\u2019 is a blend of both natural and synthetic ingredients\u2014so which is better? Let\u2019s find out! Natural fragrances come from essential oils, natural isolates, resins and plant extracts - sourced from natural materials like flowers, fruits, spices, and woods, and other raw, botanical ingredients. They often appear in organic beauty products, aromatherapy oils, and so called clean perfumes. Pros: Free from synthetic chemicals, and artificial scents Derived from plant-based, renewable resources Commonly linked to therapeutic benefits (aromatherapy) Cons: Short-lasting (often fades within 2 hours) Limited scent variations (nature only provides so many scents!) High resource demand - hundreds of pounds of plant materials are required for small amounts of essential oils Many assume that if a product contains natural oils it automatically means it is \"safe\", however, this is not always the case. Sometimes, essential oils can trigger issues like: Skin irritation & allergies: Naturally occurring plants and spices like Lavendar, citrus, and cinnamon are common allergens, and make exacerbate allergies especially in sensitive individuals Photosensitivity: Citrus oils, like bergamot, can make your skin more sensitive to the sun Hormone effects: Some plant-derived compounds like phytoestrogens are naturally occurring oestrogens and may have unknown long-term effects Toxicity at high doses: Certain essential oils e.g. tea tree or eucalyptus oil can be toxic if ingested or used in high concentrations  Synthetic scents are solely created in laboratories - 95% of their ingredients are derived from petroleum sources. They mimic natural scents or introduce completely new ones that don't exist in nature, some of these synthetic scents contain toxic chemicals. Pros: Longer-lasting scents (6-12 hours) A wider variety of scents, including fantasy scents that nature cannot provide More affordable with natural fragrances More stable and consistent in performance Cons Can contain potentially harmful chemicals Some synthetic compounds don't break down easily, and can accumulate in the body and in the environment Higher likelihood of triggering allergies or sensitivities There is a lot of debate around the safety of synthetic scents, due to the presence of certain chemicals, masked underneath the unregulated term 'fragrance' on product labels. Pthalates: Previously used to stabilize scents, phthalates are known endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which can cause endocrine (hormone) disruption and has been linked to - higher blood pressure, dysregulated thyroid function, and even diabetes! Despite these chemicals being phased out of fragrances - they may still be found in older formulations Synthetic musk compounds: A class of additives used as the base note of many perfume formulas. Some synthetic musk compounds have been detected in human tissue and even human breast milk. Some studies have linked synthetic musk compounds like musk ketone and tonalide with endocrine dysfunction and increased breast cancer risk Allergic reactions: More common in sensitive individuals, synthetic fragrance chemicals can cause skin irritation, respiratory issues, and migraines  Both synthetic fragrances and natural fragrances can include a surprising array of chemicals. The difference is that synthetics are lab-made while naturals come primarily from plants. The truth is, neither is automatically safe or harmful by virtue of where it\u2019s sourced. Instead, it all comes down to the specific chemicals and how your body reacts. Don\u2019t forget: allergens like cinnamal, citral, eugenol, and geraniol occur naturally but can still irritate your skin if you\u2019re sensitive. So ultimately, it\u2019s not simply about \u201cplant vs. lab,\u201d but whether specific fragrance molecules are used safely. Bottom line: you may find beneficial compounds in naturals or more controlled formulations in synthetics, but do your homework. Read labels and watch how your skin (and nose) responds. If you want a scent that lingers, synthetic fragrance will win hands down. Natural fragrance, \u2014from essential oils and resins, whilst beautiful, tend to evaporate within a couple of hours. However, some brands often use fixatives (either natural or synthetic) to enhance longevity. Synthetics, on the other hand, can be formulated to last 6-12 hours (or even more) on the skin. This means if you\u2019re looking for a fragrance that lingers until late evening, synthetics have an edge. Meanwhile, purely natural fragrances are more subtle, which some actually prefer. Natural fragrance: 1-2 hours (without fixatives) Synthetic fragrance: 6-12 + hours Note, concentration also matters. A Parfum (20\u201330% aromatic compounds) will outlast an Eau de Cologne (2\u20134%), regardless of whether it\u2019s natural or synthetic! If you're unsure whether your perfume, cosmetic or household products contains synthetic ingredients, here are some clues: The ingredient list - if the label 'fragrance' or 'parfum' without specifying natural sources, it's likely synthetic Super unique scents - if your perfume smells like cotton candy, and bubble gum, or an impossible mix of fruits, chances are it is a blend of synthetic ingredients Brand transparency - natural brands proudly disclose their '100% natural ingredients', if a brand is being vague about their ingredients, they're probably using synthetic fragrances Synthetic fragrances can be hard to spot as they are under single terms like 'perfume', 'fragrance' or 'parfum'. However, some common ones to look out for include: Vanillin - a synthetic version of vanilla, which is more affordable Calone - a fresh, aqautic scent responsible for that crisp ocean breeze smell in many perfumes Aldehydes - famous in Chanel No. 5 perfume, this adds a sparkling, fizziness to fragrances Ethyl maltol - a sweet, candy-like scent that creates a caramalized sugar effect The term 'fragrance' on a label can hide a cocktail of chemicals. - sometimes up to 3,000 different compounds, according to the Environmental Working Group (EWG)! Companies in fragrance industries can classify these mixtures as proprietary \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d which lets them list a single word (\u201cfragrance\u201d or \u201cparfum\u201d) rather than naming all ingredients. The European Union (EU) is stricter than the U.S. on transparency, requiring the disclosure of 26 specific fragrance allergens. In the U.S., guidelines often come from industry\u2019s own group (IFRA or RIFM), rather than direct government regulation (Fragrance - Safe Cosmetics). An analysis by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) discovered an average of 14 hidden ingredients in popular perfumes. .  Have you ever dreamed of the scent of a field of roses? It\u2019s lovely in theory, but producing just a tiny bit of rose oil can require thousands of blossoms. And that\u2019s a lot of farming, land, and water use. Even responsibly sourced naturals can come with a serious carbon footprint\u2014from the energy for steam distillation to shipping raw materials halfway across the globe. Overharvesting - high demands for ingredients like sandalwood, vanilla, frankincense for oils and natural scents can lead to deforestation and habitat destruction Resource-intensive - it takes hundreds of pounds of plant materials to make just 1 liter of essential oil On the flip side, synthetic fragrance relies on industrial chemistry, typically from petrochemicals, which we all know ties back to fossil fuels. That\u2019s not without impact. But lab-made ingredients can reduce the pressure on wild plant populations (for example, synthetic musk helps us avoid hunting musk deer). If a biotech process can create the same scent with minimal land or water, we may actually preserve more biodiversity. Petroleum-based ingredients - As 95% of synthetic fragrances are comprised of these ingredients, synergic fragrance production is heavily reliant on non-renewable fossil fuels Environmental pollution - When products containing synergic fragrance chemicals products are washed down the sink, they pollute our water supplies and soil, and as these chemicals do not break down easily they can be challenging to remove from our water! Microplastics - Some perfume suppliers use synthetic polymers, contributing to microplastic pollution. Essentially, both \u201c100% natural\u201d or \u201cfully synthetic\u201d can have environmental pitfalls, so the real solution often lies in well-managed sourcing and production across the entire chain. If \u201cFragrance\u201d is a single line on the ingredient list, the brand may not be transparent. Sensitive skin? - Look for hypoallergenic synthetics or naturally distilled 'single-note' fragrances when it comes to perfume. When searching for cosmetics and household products that are sensitive skin friendly opt for fragrance free! Check for Potential Allergens: Both natural and synthetic ingredients can trigger reactions. Keep an eye out for terms like limonene, linalool, cinnamal, or any synthetic musks. Wanting a longer-lasting scent?- Choose safe synthetic or blended fragrance (synthetic & natural fragrance) Prefer clean beauty? - Opt for certified natural perfumes with organic essential oils. Some certifications to look out for include - ECOCERT, USDA Organic, EWG Verified, COSMOS ensure transparency and ingredient purity, if you see these on your product - you can trust them Ingredient decoding apps - Think Dirty or Yuka are apps you can use to scan your products to determine whether your products contain synthetic fragrance and other nasties! Concerned about sustainability? - Seek brands that use ethically sourced natural ingredients or eco-friendly synthetic alternatives. Look for Cradle to Cradle certification or B-Corp brands that prioritize sustainability You deserve to know what\u2019s in your favorite scents. Synthetic fragrance vs natural fragrance isn\u2019t a simple \u201cgood vs bad\u201d debate\u2014each has perks and pitfalls. If you prioritize molecular complexity, therapeutic benefits, and direct connection to nature, natural fragrances might be your perfect match, despite their shorter staying power and higher price point. They evolve beautifully on your skin and offer that irreplaceable depth that comes from hundreds of interacting molecules. On the other hand, if longevity, consistency, affordability, and wider scent possibilities top your list, synthetic fragrances have clear advantages. . The truth is, there's no one-size-fits-all answer\u2014it really depends on what matters most to you personally: health, longevity, environmental stewardship... Then read labels, look for transparent brands, research any concerns about particular compounds, ask questions, and follow your instincts.  Natural fragrances are plant-derived but can often be short-lived and require large amounts of raw materials to cultivate small amounts of natural product Synthetic fragrance last longer, offering a broader range of scents but the artificial chemicals can raise safety concerns surround increased cancer risk and hormone disruption Fragrance labelling lacks transparency, chemicals hidden under vague terms like 'fragrance' or 'parfum' makes it hard to know what it is in your products Sustainability challenges exist for both types - natural scents can lead to over harvesting of finite resources, while synthetic ones contribute to pollution Yes, Chanel does use synthetic fragrances in their perfumes, with Chanel No. 5 being the most famous example that incorporated synthetic aldehydes when it was created in 1921. Ernest Beaux, the perfumer who created Chanel No. 5, used aliphatic aldehydes to add a \"sparkly top note\" to the perfume's base of rose and jasmine. Containing a mixture of aldehydes C-10, C-11, and C-12 MNA, Chanel No. 5 is known as the fragrance that popularized aldehydes as an ingredient in perfumery Artificial fragrances are made from synthetic ingredients and have a scent and/or chemical composition not known to be found in nature. These fragrances are created in a lab, typically using alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, and/or lactones, which can be combined to smell like scents found in nature (like flowers or fruit) or to create completely artificial scents unlike anything natural. By simply using the term \"fragrance\" on their label, companies can legally use over hundreds of ingredients in order to protect their trade formulas. Non natural synthetic fragrance can cause numerous health issues, with allergic reactions being among the most common, including skin rashes, headaches, migraines, and respiratory problems. Many chemicals in synthetic fragrances, such as phthalates and synthetic musks, are known endocrine disruptors that can mimic human hormones, potentially leading to cancer, infertility, and other hormone-related issues. Regular exposure to artificial fragrances has been linked to asthma, difficulty breathing, and neurological symptoms such as brain fog, dizziness, and headaches, which is particularly concerning for individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions.

Learn more \u2192 Have you ever grabbed a pair of underwear simply because it felt soft or looked cute\u2014and never stopped to wonder if it was actually safe for your body? I used to do exactly that. I used to believe cotton underwear was the best choice to keep my most sensitive area safe from toxins and infections until I found out that even cotton undies can be packed with concerning chemicals \u2014 leading me to search for the best non toxic underwear. When it comes to style, there\u2019s no shortage of adorable options in every imaginable fabric\u2014especially synthetics. But in my experience, even well-meaning recommendations to \u201cjust wear cotton\u201d can miss a crucial detail: conventional cotton is often riddled with pesticide residues that may be linked to serious health concerns like cancer. Unfortunately, synthetic fabrics bring their own problems. Many are loaded with endocrine disruptors (like BPA and phthalates), formaldehyde, toxic dyes, and finishing agents. Want the full story? Head to our guide on toxic clothing. Alexandra Scranton from Women\u2019s Voices for the Earth cautions that your vulva and vagina can soak up chemicals more quickly than anywhere else in your body. That means whatever undies you wear all day might be delivering uninvited toxins to a very delicate area. So I dove deep into the research to find truly toxin free options and best non toxic underwear brands available on the market . Now, I can share my handpicked favorites for best non toxic underwear, the safest fabrics to rely on, certifications that matter, and the real-life health benefits of steering clear of chemicals down there.  Above all else, underwear must be safe. You\u2019re wearing it against the most delicate, absorbent region of your body, and for me, that\u2019s reason enough to avoid any possible toxins. Unfortunately, most women\u2019s panties are made from synthetic materials. But what\u2019s the issue with synthetic underwear? Here\u2019s a quick breakdown I\u2019ve put together so you can decide whether they\u2019re worth keeping in your drawer. It\u2019s often said cotton beats synthetic fabrics for breathability\u2014but does that make it safe? Let\u2019s explore both. Polyester and other synthetic materials are treated with chemicals that may affect your health, including: Antimony \u2013 A metal linked to cancer and potential damage to the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) \u2013 These substances can lead to obesity, thyroid disruption, fertility issues, and cancer\u2014just to name a few. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) \u2013 Released from dyes and synthetic fabrics, it can trigger headaches and dizziness. Formaldehyde \u2013 A known human carcinogen used to set dyes that offgas. Phthalates \u2013 An endocrine disruptor used in synthetic fabrics to make them more flexible. Bisphenols (BPA and BPS) \u2013 These are endocrine disruptors tied to reproductive harm and developmental challenges. A recent study shows 30% of underwear samples contained these toxins, with 10% exceeding safety limits! Chlorine Bleach \u2013 Used to whiten fabrics, it can be toxic and irritating upon skin contact. Azo Dyes \u2013 Popular textile dyes used for their vibrant colors. Azo dyes and their breakdown products can lead to allergic reactions and even cancer. Heavy Metals \u2013 Including lead and chromium, found in dyes and fabric finishes, which can irritate skin, damage organs, or increase cancer risk. And while cotton is a better alternative to synthetic materials, it's not completely safe either. Most cotton underwear is made of conventional cotton, which is processed with multiple harsh chemicals \u2014such as pesticides and chlorine bleach\u2014 and may leave toxic residues on the final fabric. So, is synthetic or cotton underwear better? Cotton is typically safer and more breathable, but only if it\u2019s truly free of pesticides and chemical finishes, like organic options. For the best results, we need to look for GOTS-certified organic cotton or other verified natural fabrics that steer clear of toxins. So, why risk your health when there are comfy, non toxic alternatives with a wide range of styles?

With Kent's underwear collection, you won't have to worry about that. I was truly impressed to discover that you can compost Kent underwear once it has reached the end of its life. The brand even put its organic cotton underwear to the test with LA Compost and it fully degraded within 90 days! What makes them compostable? The brand's bikinis, hipsters, high-waist briefs, and thongs are completely synthetic-free. But no worries, they won\u2019t start falling apart in your underwear drawer. While Kent undies are biodegradable, they\u2019re surprisingly durable and soft for everyday use.  Image @ Kent Vaginal Infections: Synthetics don\u2019t breathe well, which can trap moisture and heat. Board-certified OB-GYN Alyssa Dweck notes this may lead to yeast infections, irritation, and rashes. Skin Irritation & Allergies: Harsh chemicals can cause mild to severe irritation, allergic reactions, or textile dermatitis. Reproductive issues: Phthalates, BPA, and PFAS may decrease fertility and potentially contribute to disorders like polycystic ovarian syndrome and endometriosis. Developmental problems: PFAS in underwear may lead to low birth weight and accelerate puberty. Cancer risk: Formaldehyde, antimony, and azo dyes are known carcinogens, so repeated exposure can raise your chances of cancer. I used to think a thorough wash could rinse away toxins. Turns out, not so much. Even if you use the gentlest, non toxic detergents you\u2019ll only remove some surface-level chemicals. Worse yet, many of these substances remain at levels considered high-risk even after washing. The environment also takes a hit each time we wash underwear made from synthetic materials: Water Pollution: Some chemicals in underwear, like bisphenols, may pollute oceans if not fully removed by wastewater treatments. Microplastics: Polyester also contributes to microplastic pollution, releasing toxic additives that may affect aquatic life. If you want to be certain your underwear is truly safe, look for sustainable materials, natural fabrics and azo-free dyes. Also check for reputable certifications and ethical supply-chain info. Soft, organic, and chemical-light natural fabrics let your body breathe and help prevent infections. Good picks include: Organic cotton Bamboo Lyocell Tencel Hemp Organic Peace silk  To answer this question, it really depends on your personal preferences. So, I've summarized some key points to consider when choosing the best natural fabric for underwear: Material Safety Impact Costs Properties Organic cotton Free from harmful chemicals and grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers Uses less water than conventional cotton, but still significant Generally affordable Soft, hypoallergenic, and breathable Bamboo Lyocell Bamboo lyocell follows a low-tox, closed-loop process, but bamboo viscose uses harsh chemicals Derived from responsibly harvested bamboo and requires less water Moderate Soft, breathable, hypoallergenic, antimicrobial and natural moisture-wicking properties Tencel Adheres to strict safety standards and uses very few chemicals compared to other fibers Sustainable sourcing. Minimal water usage and generates less waste Usually expensive Extremely soft, durable, and breathable Hemp Hemp can be produced through a chemical-free mechanical process, but \u201chemp viscose\u201d is processed with toxic chemicals Uses less water and restores soil health Usually expensive Breathable and antimicrobial. Softens with washing but initially rougher than others fabrics Organic peace silk Organic silk uses the same process as conventional silk but with pesticide-free mulberry leaves Not vegan, but ensures animal welfare and environmental care Expensive Soft, gentle, and luxurious feel These sustainability certifications can help you ensure your underwear is free from harmful chemicals: OEKO-TEX certified: Certifies that a product is free from over 100 harmful substances. Global Organic Textile Standard: Certifies that products contain at least 70% organic fibers, do not include hazardous substances, and use only GOTS-approved colorants. USDA Organic: Certifies products made with at least 70% organic materials, but it does not guarantee non-toxic dye usage. If fair pay and safe working conditions matter to you, look for sustainable brands that provide information about material sourcing, fair trade practices, factory operations, and labor conditions. Look for Fairtrade International, Fair Trade Certified, World Fair Trade Organization, GOTS, and B Corp labels to confirm ethical commitments.  Opt for Natural Fabrics: Especially organic cotton, bamboo lyocell, or TENCEL\u2122 for breathability and minimal chemicals. Look for Non Toxic Dyes: Azo-free, GOTS-approved, or plant-based. Check Certifications: GOTS, OEKO-TEX, USDA Organic, etc. Support Ethical Brands: Prioritize transparent supply chains with fair wages. Wash Mindfully: Even the best non toxic underwear deserves gentle, eco-friendly laundering. Yes. Organic cotton underwear reduces chemical exposure in sensitive areas and helps prevent bacterial growth. Conventional cotton may contain toxins like PFAS and formaldehyde, while organic cotton is grown without harmful pesticides. It also tends to last longer under frequent washing. Though it can cost more upfront, it often proves more economical over time thanks to durability and fewer negative health impacts Skip any that are made with synthetic materials treated with formaldehyde, azo dyes, flame retardants, or PFAS\u2014especially in period underwear. These \u201cforever chemicals\u201d can disrupt hormones and never break down in the environment. Polyester and nylon trap heat and moisture, which may lead to increased bacterial growth. Conventional cotton also poses issues due to heavy pesticide use and high water consumption. Bright synthetic dyes can irritate skin and pollute waterways when manufactured or washe [Bamboo is notably softer and wicks moisture more efficiently than cotton, helping you stay drier and fresher. It typically requires less water and fewer pesticides to grow, making it an eco-friendlier choice. Bamboo fabric also has natural antimicrobial properties. However, it can cost more and sometimes prove less durable. Cotton\u2014especially organic cotton\u2014may last longer with repeated washing, so it\u2019s a tradeoff between immediate comfort and long-term wear Non-toxic underwear is made from natural fibers\u2014ideally certified organic cotton (GOTS, OEKO-TEX). PFAS-free period underwear options rely on organic cotton and bamboo to avoid harmful treatments. Truly non-toxic garments skip synthetic dyes, formaldehyde finishes, and antimicrobial coatings containing triclosan. Bamboo is also safe when processed mechanically rather than chemically. Always check brand transparency, certifications, and manufacturing details for proof Many experts recommend organic cotton for breathability, moisture absorption, and hypoallergenic benefits. Bamboo provides extra softness and antimicrobial properties but may cost more and wear faster. Tencel is silky, sustainable alternative derived from wood pulp, while merino wool offers odor resistance and temperature control. Hemp and linen are highly durable but not as soft for daily intimates. Your ideal fabric depends on comfort, budget, and personal preferences.

In some cases, it can even be 100 times worse - That's why it's crucial to detoxify home environments from harmful toxins and improve your air quality! Over 99% of the world's population live in homes that exceed the World Health Organisation's (WHO) indoor air quality limits. Household air pollution contributes to over 3.2 million deaths globally every year, which is shocking considering that our homes are meant to be our safe haven. While burning solid fuels like wood and coal is a major contributor, everyday activities like cooking, cleaning and even lighting candles can release dangerous chemicals into your space, affecting indoor air quality. From furniture, mattresses and clothing to laundry detergents, many common household products are packed with toxic chemicals that cause a plethora of health problems like allergies, hormone imbalances, and chronic health problems. But here's the good news: you can detoxify home easily with a few simple changes! This non-toxic living guide will walk you through eight easy steps to help you to reduce toxins, improve air quality and swap harmful products with non-toxic home essentials - helping you create a healthier, happier living space for you and your family.  Think of home detoxification as a health upgrade. It's all about reducing your exposure to dangerous chemicals lurking in everyday items and making mindful choices to switch to safer, non-toxic products. It's not about it being perfect, but rather enjoying the process of making your home toxin-free one step at a time. A study published in Environmental Science & Technology found 45 potentially harmful chemicals in household products like vinyl flooring, home furnishings, and personal care products. Co-author Veena Singla warns \"Harmful chemicals used in everyday products and building materials result in widespread contamination of our homes - these dangerous chemicals should be replaced with safer alternatives.\" Why its important? Even if you're don't realize it, you're constantly exposed to toxins that accumulate in your body over time. Scientists refer to this as your 'body burden' - the total chemical load from all the various products you use daily. Even at low exposures, these chemicals build up and can affect multiple organ systems, increasing the risk of long-term health problems. A 2020 study found 271 compounds in household dust. These included pesticides (38 types), surfactants (30 types), cosmetic-related chemicals (28 types), which many detected in 50% of all dust samples from peoples homes! So, even if you keep your home spotless, invisible pollutants can still linger - some of the biggest sources include: Toxic cleaning products - Many contain ammonia, chlorine, and artificial fragrance release harmful fumes that irritate your lungs and skin Kitchen Hazards- Nonstick cookware (Teflon) and gas stoves release toxic fumes that can linger in your kitchen air Off-gassing furniture and flooring - Pressed wood furniture, vinyl flooring, paints and carpets emit VOCs (volatile organic compounds) over time Hidden allergens in household dust - Dust mites, mold spores, pet dander and dangerous chemicals settle in household dust, affecting air quality Personal care product overload - Many shampoos, body washes and cosmetics sneak in endocrine-disrupting chemicals masked under vague terms like 'fragrance' Hidden toxins in bedding and upholstery - Pillows, sofas and mattresses may contain flame retardants and shed microplastics! Water contamination risks - Tap water may contain lead, pesticides and even forever chemicals (PFAS), which do not break down in the body According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) most people spend 90% of your time indoors - so the quality of your home's air matters! Poor air quality has been linked to health problems like asthma, cognitive issues, and even cancer. But don't worry - you can freshen your air naturally - it can be as simple as opening your windows! Open your windows daily - Let the fresh air in and stale air out - by keeping humidity levels between 30-50%you reduce mold and dust mite build-up and improve indoor air quality Use air-purifying plants - Snake plants, peace lilies and aloe vera act as natural air filters. (Seriously, my snake plant has made a significant difference!) Invest in a HEPA air purifier - These trap fine particles, allergens and VOCs to keep your air fresh Leave shoes at the door - Outdoor pollutants like pesticides and dirt can easily track inside and bring contaminants indoors. Get yourself a shoe rack near your door, and remember to always remove your shoes when you walk inside Ditch the toxic candles - Paraffin wax candles release harmful VOCs. Swap them for beeswax or soy candlesthat burn cleanly!  Many store-bought cleaning products and air fresheners contain harsh chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and hormone-disrupting chemicals like phthalates and synthetic fragrances. These linger in the air and can trigger health issues like allergies, hormone imbalances, and even respiratory problems. Did you know many air fresheners release over 100 chemicals - including VOCs and carcinogens like benzene and toluene? Even the ones labeled 'natural' or 'green' aren't always safe! Switch to non-toxic cleaning products - some great options are Branch Basics, Seventh Generation (my personal favourite, all of my products are from here, as they're available from the supermarket), ECOS Look for fragrance-free options - Avoid synthetic scents in cleaning products and air fresheners, these often contain phthalates- the hormone disrupting chemical! DIY your cleaners - Vinegar, baking soda, and essential oils make powerful natural cleaning products and work wonders. Don't believe me? Give it a go and check out our DIY natural cleaners article for a step by step guide in making your own homemade cleaners! Ditch synthetic air fresheners - Instead use non-toxic air fresheners, essential oil diffusers, natural potpouurri or simmer herbs and citrus peels on the stove - for a natural aroma that circulates your whole home!  Your kitchen may be one of the most toxic rooms in the house containing many toxic home products! Cooking alone releases harmful chemicals like particulate matters (PMs), VOCs, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. If your kitchen isn't well ventilated, these toxins can reach harmful levels and even increase risk of respiratory health issues like asthma. Easy Kitchen Home Detox Swaps Upgrade your non-stick cookware (Teflon) - Overheating teflon pans releases toxic PFAS, also known as \"forever chemicals\", which are especially hard to get rid of, in the environment and in your body too! Toss the teflon and try a cast-iron or stainless steel - these options are long lasting and free from toxic emissions! Switch to glass (my favourite) or stainless steel rather than plastic containers for your food avoid endocrine disruptors - plastic containers contain BPA and phthalates that leach into your food, especially when microwaved and can deposit microplastics in your food. Go wooden with cutting boards - I have and never looked back - wood is durable, better for the environment and can reduce microplastic contamination in your food  Ever wonder why you wake up feeling groggy? It may not be your sleep but the toxins in your bedding or surroundings - Your mattress and even sofas 'off-gas' chemical like VOC for years after they enter your home. Your mattress, bedding, and pillows are filled with flame retardants, synthetic dyes, and VOCs that pollute your indoor air quality! Choose organic bedding made from natural fibers opt for cotton, wool, or linen that are free of toxic dyes and treatments! Your skin will thank you! Go non-toxic with your mattress - GOTs-certified or natural latex mattresses are best to avoid VOCs and flame retardants Use fragrance-free laundry detergent - skip the synthetic fragrance, and try out a more gentle, eco-friendly alternative that keep your bedding fresh and clean without irritating your skin. Let your new furniture breathe - new furniture must air out before bringing it inside your home, to prevent VOCs accumulating in your house!  We all assume our tap water is safe, but did you know it could be loaded with toxins like lead, pesticides and pharmaceuticals, and PFAS? All these chemicals resist in our environment - and in our bodies - for years! Filter it out - thankfully, water filters like NSF-certified filters (carbon filters, gravity-fed filters or reverse osmosis systems) are great for removing contaminants and improving your water quality. I use a Brita, and you'd be surprised the difference in taste too! Ditch plastic bottles - be a convert to glass or stainless steel bottles to reduce microplastic exposure, and this will also save you buying bottles when you're out and about!  Dust is loaded with chemicals, like VOCs, heavy metals and flame retardants. So, best believe if you do not regularly clean, these will build up overtime and impact your air quality - the more clutter you have, the more places these toxins can accumulate! Vacuum with a HEPA-filter - these filters great for trapping fine particles and allergens effectively that regular vacuums miss, give your home a deeper clean Adopt a minimilist approach - fewer knickknacks means fewer places to collect, and fewer things to clean. Plus, your space will feel more open and relaxing Use cloths and wet mops - say goodbye to your dry duster that pushes dust around. Cloths are better at trapping dust, and a wet mop will ensure this dust is gone! Wash soft surfaces regularly - curtains, rugs and bedding are dust magnets, toss them in the wash to keep your home cleaner and your air fresher  Your bathroom may be hiding many hidden chemicals like parabens, phthalates, synthetic fragrance - even some of the so-called 'natural' products organised on your shelves can hide harmful organic chemicals that contribute to hormone disruption and skin irritation. Since 2009, 595 cosmetic manufacturers have reported using 88 harmful chemicals in over 73,000 products, according to the Environmental Working Group (EWG). Many of these chemicals have been linked to birth defects and reproductive harm, and some have even been banned in other countries\u2014yet they still appear in everyday personal care products. Go organise with personal care products - Look for brands free of parabens, sulphates and synthetic fragrance, many brands will proudly label these on their packaging. You will also notice a significant difference in your skin - I did! Avoid products with 'fragrance' on the label - The word 'fragrance' is catch-all term for all undisclosed chemicals that are linked to hormone disruption. Stick to unscented or naturally scented products instead Check product safety - use the EWG Skin Deep Database or the Think Dirty app to find safe, non toxic cosmetic products Look for trusted certifications like EWG Verified, USDA Organic, Made Safe Certified and Leaping Bunny are all solid labels to trust when looking for new products Go low-COV or no-VOC with bath accessories - Choose non-toxic shower curtains and bath products to minimize air pollutants in your bathroom  Revonovating your home or redecorating? Be mindful with the products you use as many paints, flooring and building materials off-gas harmful chemicals like VOCs linger in the air for months - or even years! Plus, if you live in an older home lead paint can pose serious health risks - espeically for children - this paint can be harmful as it can chip over time and release into the air. Choose low-VOC or no-VOC paints - traditional paints can release toxic chemicals like benzene and toluene (known carcinogens) and formaldehyde that can linger in the air for years! Low-VOC paints are a safer, and healthier option - you can find them by looking at packaging at hardware shops! Look for products with a green label certifications - products like Green Seal, Greenguard Gold or EcoLogo should be your go-to for safety Go natural with flooring - Choose sustainable materials like cork, bamboo or reclaimed wood are all non-toxic and sustainable options, and help you avoid toxins found in synthetic flooring Opt for sustainable home decor - avoid synthetic rugs and curtains, instead choose organic cotton, jute, hemp or wool or even upcycle vintage furniture instead of buying new items that may contain toxins  Indoor air can be up to 100x more polluted than outdoor air - ventilate daily or invest in an air purifier to freshen up your space naturally Cut down on hidden toxins - swap synthetic cleaning supplies, air fresheners, and personal care products for non-toxic, eco-friendly alternatives Your kitchen could be a hidden toxin zone - avoid nonstick cookware and plastic food storage \u2014go for cast iron, glass, and ensure kitchen is always properly ventilated especially when cooking! Furniture and bedding can off-gas harmful chemicals - opt for organic, GOTS-certified bedding and non-toxic mattresses to reduce exposure to flame retardants and VOCs Your water isn\u2019t always as clean as it seems - filter your tap water to remove contaminants like PFAS and ditch plastic bottles for glass or stainless steel! Declutter and dust often to reduce toxic buildup! Household dust traps harmful chemicals, so vacuum with a HEPA filter and wipe those surfaces with microfiber cloths! Sustainable swaps = healthier home & planet - opt for low-VOC paints, natural flooring, and upcycled furniture to create a toxin-free, eco-friendly living space Detoxifying your home doesn\u2019t have to be overwhelming\u2014small, intentional changes can make a big difference in your air quality, health, and overall well-being. By swapping out toxic household products, improving ventilation, and choosing safer materials, you\u2019re creating a cleaner home, and also protecting your family from harmful chemicals. Start today\u2014because a non-toxic home is a healthy home! You can detox your home by reducing indoor air pollution, switching to non-toxic cleaning products, improving ventilation, using air-purifying plants, and avoiding synthetic materials that off-gas VOCs. Simple swaps like glass food storage containers, organic bedding, and a HEPA air purifier can significantly improve indoor air quality. Detoxifying your body starts with hydration, a nutrient-rich diet, and lifestyle changes. Drink plenty of water, eat antioxidant-rich foods, sweat through exercise or saunas, and use dry brushing to support lymphatic drainage. Reducing toxin exposure in your home and personal care products also helps lighten your body\u2019s toxic load. Start by replacing conventional cleaning supplies, candles, and air fresheners with non-toxic alternatives. Improve ventilation by opening windows daily, use HEPA filters, and minimize household dust, which often contains pollutants. Switching to organic or sustainably made furniture, bedding, and flooring can also help eliminate long-term exposure to VOCs. Millie Chamberlain is a passionate medical writer based in London.

The skin around your eyes is thinner and more sensitive than the rest of your face\u2014and, frankly, that\u2019s what makes it more prone to irritation, redness, or dryness.

Yet research also shows that switching to \u201cclean\u201d personal care products markedly reduce one\u2019s exposure to these harmful chemicals. In one study, teenage girls who replaced conventional cosmetics with paraben- and phthalate-free products saw a 44% drop in certain paraben levels in just three days.

You might notice your under-eye area shows signs of aging or fatigue faster than anywhere else\u2014annoying, right? From crow\u2019s feet to dark circles, I know how tempting it is to just grab the latest miracle cream. However, understanding potential risks in conventional products is key to protecting both your skin\u2019s vitality and its overall tone. But many conventional formulas can irritate sensitive skin or carry serious long-term health risks. Let\u2019s look at why picking a clean, non-toxic product is so important. Immediate Health Risks Eyelid dermatitis: Did you know certain cosmetics can cause eyelid dermatitis? That\u2019s because this area absorbs allergens more easily than thicker facial skin, making it more prone to contact dermatitis. A lot of common eye cream ingredients\u2014such as sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), methylisothiazolinone, and methylchloroisothiazolinone\u2014can trigger reactions here. Long-term Health Risks Beyond immediate skin reactions, researchers are investigating how long-term exposure to \u201ctoxic\u201d beauty ingredients might contribute to chronic health conditions: Endocrine Disruption: Many eye creams contain harsh ingredients, such as parabens and phthalates. Both are known endocrine disruptors, which means they can mimic certain hormones and interfere with some of your body\u2019s functions. Multiple studies link long-term, high exposure to these ingredients with an increased risk of developing health issues such as reproductive problems, breast cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. Some suggest that removing or limiting these chemicals in your routine can meaningfully reduce your body\u2019s overall chemical burden. Luckily, you don\u2019t have to compromise on results just because you\u2019re avoiding toxic ingredients. Clean, natural eye creams can handle dark circles, puffiness, and wrinkles just as effectively\u2014though consistency is key. No skincare formula works overnight, but if you\u2019re disciplined, the payoff is worth it. So why rely on chemicals when you can choose an effective, safer routine? \"Best\" Pai Skincare | Shop here* Annmarie Skincare | Shop here* Weleda | Shop here* \"Better\" BIOSSANCE | Shop here* 100% Pure | Shop here* 100% Pure | Shop here* Cocokind | Shop here* OSEA | Shop here* True Botanicals | Shop here* Tata Harper | Shop here* Beauty by Earth | Shop here* Whenever I try to find the best clean eye cream, I dive into ingredient labels, test formulas myself, and scroll through countless reviews from fellow clean beauty lovers.

I gently dab it around my eyes and on my lips before bed, and it\u2019s made a noticeable difference in hydration and smoothness. Pro Tip #2: For anyone dealing with severely dry or sensitive skin, I can\u2019t recommend Primally Pure Baby Balm* enough. It\u2019s not your typical eye cream\u2014it\u2019s a protective balm formulated for babies\u2014but its soothing qualities are incredible around delicate skin. If your under-eye area needs some serious TLC, this could be your secret weapon! So why go \u201cclean\u201d with your eye cream? Here\u2019s a quick rundown of how a non-toxic, natural eye cream can level up your routine: Safer Ingredients (No Harsh Chemicals) \u2013 You dodge known offenders like parabens, which can mess with your hormones. No phthalates, no formaldehyde releasers. It\u2019s peace of mind for both skin and long-term health. Gentler on Sensitive Skin \u2013 The under-eye area is thin and extra-absorbent. Clean formulas skip heavy fragrances and other top irritants. Instead, they use soothing elements like aloe or chamomile to calm and hydrate. Nutrient-Rich, Botanical Ingredients \u2013 Think: almond oil, shea butter, green tea. These natural wonders are packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and fatty acids, which deeply nourish and fight signs of aging. Environmentally & Ethically Friendly \u2013 Most clean beauty brands also focus on sustainable packaging, organic farming, and cruelty-free testing. It feels good knowing you\u2019re helping the planet while caring for your skin. Trying to decode ingredient lists can feel daunting. I used to feel overwhelmed too\u2014so many chemical names! Luckily, you can learn a few simple tricks to decode ingredients lists. Alternatively, you can use reputable ingredient-checker apps to make reading these lists a lot easier. This way, you'll know if a product is truly safe for your health. Here are some big no-nos when you\u2019re picking a clean eye cream: Parabens \u2013 Like propylparaben and isopropylparaben, parabens are linked to hormone disruption and are considered a High Hazard by the EWG. Methylisothiazolinone & Methylchloroisothiazolinone \u2013 These preservatives are the most predominant contact allergens in cosmetics, especially when used together. Formaldehyde-releasers \u2013 As the name suggests, ingredients such as DMDM hydantoin, imidazolidinyl urea, quaternium-15, and diazolidinyl urea can release small amounts of formaldehyde\u2014a known carcinogen. Fragrance \u2013 This \"ingredient\" can actually encompass hundreds of undisclosed chemicals linked to allergies, skin irritation, and endocrine disruption. Phthalates \u2013 Endocrine disruptors, often hidden under the term 'Fragrance'. To avoid this chemical, look for fragrance-free or naturally scented eye creams. Disodium EDTA \u2013 While considered safe on its own, it helps the skin absorb other ingredients faster. If the formula contains this ingredient along with other harmful chemicals, your body may absorb them more easily. Ethanol - This ingredient can also facilitate the absorption of harsh chemicals in the formula like carcinogenic contaminants and other harmful ingredients. Retinyl Palmitate (Retinol) - Great for night use, but watch out in day creams. It can form free radicals under sun exposure Ethoxylated ingredients \u2013 Like sodium laureth sulfate, PEGs, Polysorbate-20, alcohol ethoxylates, and ethylene glycol. They may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, a chemical linked to cancer. Trifluoroacetyl Tripeptide-2 \u2013 This ingredient has been linked to PFAS, a class of chemicals with high toxicity concerns and potential carcinogenic effects.  So, what ingredients can deliver great results without affecting your health? Let\u2019s check out some of the top natural superstars in clean eye creams. Finding an effective non-toxic eye cream doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing results. In fact, many safe, natural ingredients can help tackle dark circles, puffiness, fine lines, and dryness\u2014and they come dermatologist-recommended. Below, we break down some of the star natural ingredients and how they benefit your skin. Caffeine - iConstricts blood vessels to reduce puffiness and swelling, and may help brighten dark circles by boosting circulation Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) \u2013 Brightens and strengthens the skin barrier. It\u2019s gentle, non-irritating, and can fade hyperpigmentation over time. Hyaluronic Acid \u2013 Draws in water to plump fine lines and maintain hydration. Our bodies naturally produce HA, so it\u2019s both effective and low-risk for irritation. Peptides \u2013 Encourage collagen and elastin production for a firmer, smoother look. They\u2019re an excellent anti-aging option without the irritation of retinol. Bakuchiol \u2013 A trendy \u201cnatural retinol alternative.\u201d It can reduce wrinkles and boost collagen minus the typical sensitivity that retinol can cause. Botanical Oils and Extracts \u2013 Think rosehip oil (rich in vitamins A and C), jojoba oil, aloe vera, or chamomile. These have a long history of healing and soothing properties, perfect for delicate under-eyes. But remember, consistency is important. Apply your chosen eye cream daily (most people prefer morning and night) on clean skin, using a light tapping motion with your ring finger to avoid tugging. With time and the help of these safe, natural ingredients, your under-eye skin can become one of the brightest, most refreshed parts of your face \u2013 no toxins required! \u00a0  If a product flaunts these clean beauty certifications, you can be more confident it\u2019s free from major toxins and is truly what it claims to be. Here are some trusted seals to look for, and what they mean:. Leaping Bunny (Cruelty-Free) \u2013 Verifies no animal testing on ingredients or final product. ECOCERT / COSMOS \u2013 European standard ensuring natural and organic formulation processes MADE SAFE \u2013 Means no known or suspected toxins that harm human health\u2014huge plus! EWG Verified \u2013 Vetted by the Environmental Working Group for top-tier safety standards. NSF Organic \u2013 At least 70% organic content. USDA Organic (95%+) is even stricter. I know there are loads of DIY eye cream recipes out there. While mixing your own oils and butters can be fun, be cautious: without proper preservatives, homemade formulas can harbor bacteria (not what you want near your eyes). That said, if you do want to DIY, keep small batches, store them properly, and toss them if you see any changes in smell or texture. Otherwise, professionally formulated products are definitely safer and tested for stability. A highly effective DIY eye serum combines 0.5 ounces each of rosehip seed oil and jojoba oil (or fractionated coconut oil) with 0.2 ounces vitamin E oil and a small amount of aloe vera gel\u2014rosehip oil targets fine lines with vitamins A, C, and essential fatty acids, while jojoba provides moisture without heaviness. When making this serum, strict attention to hygiene is crucial\u2014use sterilized containers, and again, make small batches, store in the refrigerator and throw it out after 2-3 weeks or at the first sign of changes in color, scent, or texture. Using clean eye cream helps you avoid irritants, endocrine disruptors and long term health issues Consistency pays off\u2014most formulas need regular use before you see major results. Check certifications (like EWG or MADE SAFE) for reassurance about a product\u2019s safety. Patch test if you have sensitive skin, because even \u201cmild\u201d preservatives can sometimes trigger reactions. If you enjoyed this post, check out these other articles on safe and non toxic products: Best Non Toxic Face Masks for Natural Glow Yes! The evidence strongly supports the value of specialized eye creams when formulated with effective ingredients and free from potentially harmful compounds. The under-eye area is super delicate, and specialized formulas can help address unique concerns\u2014dark circles, puffiness, and fine lines. I always see better results when I use an eye cream designed specifically for this sensitive spot compared to a generic moisturizer. Research indicates parabens are particularly problematic in eye creams, as studies show these preservatives can be toxic to corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. The link to hormone disruption is also concerning, as parabens have demonstrated estrogen-mimicking properties that could potentially impact endocrine system function with long-term use.\u00a0 Natural alternatives containing caffeine, peptides, and botanical extracts like rosehip oil offer evidence-based options for addressing common eye concerns Properly formulated eye creams from reputable brands are generally safe, but certain ingredients common in these products warrant caution due to the eye area's sensitivity. Beyond parabens, preservatives like benzalkonium chloride, formaldehyde, and phenoxyethanol have shown toxicity to ocular tissues even at approved concentrations. Clean formulations that avoid known irritants like fragrance, alcohol, and certain essential oils significantly reduce the risk of adverse reactions while still providing benefits. Products containing caffeine stand out as the most effective natural solution for eye bags, with 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream earning particular praise for its powerful de-puffing blend of green tea, coffee extract, and coffee cherry. Research shows caffeine can effectively reduce puffiness by temporarily constricting blood vessels and improving circulation in the under-eye area. Peptide-based formulas, such as OSEA Ocean Eyes, also boost collagen and improve elasticity, helping reduce the appearance of puffiness.

Learn more \u2192 Have you ever wondered if a simple, nature-derived \u201cface oil\u201d could outshine all those lotions and potions in your skincare routine? I certainly have. Natural face oils are frequently touted as \u201cclean\u201d or more eco-friendly options for hydrating and rejuvenating your skin. From jojoba oil to coconut oil, there\u2019s a growing list of plant-derived oils marketed for acne prone skin, dryness, aging concerns, and more. But do they really live up to the hype? Below, we\u2019ll take a critical yet balanced look at natural face oils\u2014exploring their potential benefits, the science behind them, possible downsides, and what dermatologists and holistic practitioners are saying. We\u2019ll also tackle common questions, like which oils might be best for face aging or for cleansing an oily T-zone.  Natural face oils\u201d generally refer to oils extracted from plants\u2014think seeds, nuts, or fruits\u2014applied to facial skin for cosmetic or therapeutic benefits. They often come cold-pressed or minimally processed, which helps retain beneficial compounds like fatty acids, vitamin E, or polyphenols. Popular choices include: Jojoba oil: Chemically akin to human sebum, can be great for acne prone skin. Rosehip oil: Loaded with vitamins A and C; often touted for anti aging and evening out skin tone. Argan oil: Contains vitamin E and antioxidants; commonly used for mature skin needing extra nourishment. Avocado oil: Rich and moisturizing, suitable for dry or sensitive skin. Some products contain 100% of one oil (e.g., pure argan oil), while others blend multiple oils\u2014like a facial oil serum combining jojoba, rosehip, and evening primrose. Different seed oils offer slightly different fatty acid profiles. Carrier oils (argan, jojoba, etc.): Usually safe to apply directly, providing emollient and occlusive benefits. Essential oils (tea tree, lavender, etc.): Highly concentrated extracts that can irritate or cause allergies if used undiluted. They may offer certain antimicrobial or soothing properties but should be approached with caution. I first started exploring these oils because I wanted a simpler way to address my oily skin, mature skin skin, in my skincare routine, free of synthetic fragrances. Indeed, holistic skincare advocates often claim that plant oils have been used for centuries to nourish skin and can be gentler and more environmentally friendly than lab-made moisturizers. For instance, in Ayurvedic medicine, oils like sesame oil have been used for facial massage and skin health for thousands of years. Natural oils are also a staple in many DIY skincare routines and are often marketed as \u201cclean beauty\" alternatives to lotions that might contain preservatives, emulsifiers, or synthetic additives. However, \u201cnatural\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically mean \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201csafer.\u201d Poisons ivy and arsenic are natural too \u2013 a reminder that we should examine evidence rather than assume all natural substances are harmless. In the context of face oils, some can indeed be beneficial, while others might do more harm than good depending on your skin type and how they\u2019re used. In the next sections, we\u2019ll explore how these oils work and what known benefits and risks they carry. Most natural face oils are lipophilic, meaning they interact readily with your skin\u2019s outer layers. Here\u2019s how: Occlusive & Emollient Action: This means they soften and smooth the skin (emollient effect) and form a protective layer that prevents moisture loss (occlusive effect). Dermatologists explain that oils themselves don\u2019t hydrate (they don\u2019t add water to the skin), but they seal in moisture and reduce trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL)\u00a0 This can make skin feel more plump and smooth , especially in dry climates or winter months. Skin Barrier Support:Our skin\u2019s outer layer naturally contains oils (sebum and lipid components) as part of a healthy barrier. When the skin\u2019s natural oils are depleted (due to harsh cleansers, dry air, aging, etc.), applying an oil can supplement those lipids. Think of it like replacing the \u201cmortar\u201d between skin cells to strengthen the skin barrier. In fact, when the skin barrier is compromised (leading to dryness, irritation, or conditions like eczema), applying lipids can help repair it Nutrient & Fatty Acids Delivery: Plant oils are composed of different fatty acids (like oleic acid, linoleic acid, lauric acid, etc.) and often contain vitamins and antioxidants (such as vitamin E, polyphenols, carotenoids). For example, rosehip seed oil is rich in vitamin E, vitamin C, and antioxidants and helps support skin tone and has even has anti aging benefits; argan oil contains vitamin E and polyphenols; sea buckthorn oil is rich in carotenoids, etc. When you apply the oil, these substances can interact with the skin\u2019s surface But oils mainly stay on the surface\u2014right where extra nourishment is often needed. When you apply the oil, these substances can interact with the skin, but\u00a0note that most oils mainly stay in skins top layer, as they don\u2019t penetrate extremely deeply\u00a0and primarily work on the surface. Oil Cleansing: Oils can dissolve other oils (like makeup, sunscreen, and excess sebum) more effectively than water alone, making them popular for oil cleansing. Dr. Kassouf mentions that some oils act as emulsifiers to lift grime, which is why double cleansing (oil first, then a gentle face wash) can leave skin clean yet not stripped. Targeted treatments: Some natural oils have specific properties. For instance, tea tree oil (an essential oil) is well-known for its antimicrobial activity against acne bacteria, and coconut oil contains lauric acid which can convert to monolaurin, a substance that can kill bacteria and fungi . Coconut oil i.e. is been used in managing eczema (where staph on the skin can worsen the condition). Castor oil is another example \u2013 it has a unique fatty acid (ricinoleic acid) that is believed to have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Certain lighter oils\u2014like jojoba oil\u2014may help acne prone or oily skin by providing moisture without overly clogging pores. However, always patch test first! Bottom line:\u00a0Natural face oils primarily work by reinforcing the skin\u2019s outer layer, preventing moisture loss, and delivering some beneficial compounds to the surface of the skin. This can result in softer, less flaky skin and a bolstered barrier. But how effective are they really, and what benefits can you expect? Natural face oils have a reputation for anti aging support, calming irritation, and boosting that radiant glow. While some of these claims are backed by scientific studies or at least plausible mechanisms, others can be more anecdotal. Let\u00b4s break down the most commonly claimed benefits of using natural face oils and evaluate each: Natural face oils can be as effective as conventional moisturizers in combating dryness. For instance, one clinical study found that virgin coconut oil performed just as well as mineral oil in treating mild to moderate dryness If you struggle with very dry or flaky skin, you might also find relief with Shea butter\u2014\u2014another plant-derived lipid that\u2019s popular in eczema care. Meanwhile, jojoba oil effectively softens skin without leaving a heavy residue, making it a good option for all skin types; anecdotal reports suggest it may even discourage excess oil production in oily skin. Anti-inflammatory oils such as argan oil or rosehip oil can further support dry skin by sealing in hydrating ingredients, like hyaluronic acid. To maximize moisture retention, apply a humectant-rich product (e.g., a serum or moisturizer) first, then follow with an oil. According to the Cleveland Clinic, this layered approach prevents transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and keeps skin hydrated longer. Keep in mind that oils alone don\u2019t add water to the skin, so it\u2019s best to pair them with a water-based product for optimal results.  Oils high in linoleic acid (like safflower, hemp seed, or sunflower) may bolster barrier function. Sunflower oil has been shown to maintain healthy barrier integrity without irritation, whereas olive oil (higher oleic acid) can sometimes disrupt delicate skin. I often mix a little of face oil into my moisturizer or serum \u2014it feels like giving my skin a hug. No oil can turn back time, but they can improve the look of aging by plumping and providing antioxidants: Hydration: Well-hydrated skin visibly reduces fine lines (at least temporarily). Antioxidants: Many oils contain vitamins A, C, E, and other compounds that fight free radicals and help prevent collagen breakdown. Collagen Support: Some oils like rosehip have a bit of vitamin A, which can mildly boost cell turnover  Surprising but true: Some oily skin folks see an improvement when using jojoba oil or hemp seed oil Linoleic Acid: Acne-prone skin is often low in this fatty acid. Using high-linoleic oils might balance your skin, as one small study on linoleic acid showed a reduction in microcomedones Antibacterial Effects: Coconut oil has lauric acid that kills some bacteria; tea tree oil can also target acne-causing bacteria, but must be diluted However, always patch test to avoid clogging pores if you have blemish prone skin. While natural face oils hold plenty of promise, they\u2019re not always a perfect fit for everyone: Some oils (coconut, cocoa butter) are notorious for clogging pores. If you\u2019re acne-prone, you may want to avoid them or proceed with caution (Dr. Vij\u2019s advice). Even \u201csafe\u201d oils can cause breakouts in certain people, highlighting the need for personal experimentation. Oils could feed yeast in seborrheic dermatitis or trap heat in rosacea, exacerbating symptoms. Rosacea patients often have an \u201caltered skin barrier\u201d that might react unpredictably to oils. Natural doesn\u2019t mean no allergies. Some essential oil n face oils can irritate sensitive skin types and  spark allergies or dermatitis, so always patch test. They lack water and humectants like glycerin or hyaluronic acid. Relying solely on oils can leave deeper layers still dehydrated. Oils also don\u2019t offer ingredients like retinol, niacinamide, or peptides, which many find essential for robust anti-aging or acne care. Oils can\u2019t singlehandedly fix deep wrinkles, severe acne, or major discoloration. Think of them as supportive tools, not miracle cures. Personal response varies\u2014a \u201choly grail\u201d for one person can cause breakouts for another. Citrus oils (bergamot, lemon, grapefruit) can cause phototoxicity if exposed to sun. Using too much oil can lead to pore suffocation or an overly greasy feel.  Based on expert recommendations and typical experiences: Acne-prone or extremely oily skin (unless carefully patch testing a low-comedogenic oil). Seborrheic dermatitis or rosacea sufferers who notice flare-ups with oils. Those allergic to a particular seed or nut (e.g., sweet almond oil can pose risks for severe nut allergies). Anyone who\u2019s tried multiple oils in the past and consistently broke out or got irritation. If you relate to these categories, consider focusing on hydrating gels, serums, or oil-free moisturizers. Most dermatologists see facial oil as a helpful final layer for certain skin types, but not an absolute must: Dr. Amy Kassouf (Cleveland Clinic) notes that while oils can help remove makeup and reduce TEWL, heavily scented essential oils may irritate. Dr. Alok Vij (Cleveland Clinic) emphasizes oils don\u2019t replace hydration and warns acne prone folks to tread carefully. Dr. Marie Hayag (NYC Dermatologist): tailors recommendations: jojoba oil for breakout-prone, argan oil or marula for mature skin, and so on. Holistic Practitioners like Barbara O\u2019Neill praise castor, coconut, and olive oil blends for \u201cdeep moisture\u201d and \u201cdetoxifying\u201d properties, citing anecdotal or historical examples. In Ayurvedic and other historical contexts, oils have been revered for centuries, suggesting cultural acceptance of these remedies. My stance: Balancing diffrent approaches\u2014and understanding what your skin specifically tolerates\u2014is the sweet spot. Not all oils suit every skin type, so here are some rules of thumb Oily or Acne-Prone Skin Try lighter oils (like jojoba, rosehip, or grapeseed). These are often high in linoleic acid, which can help balance sebum production. Heavier oils might trap debris and clog pores. Look for cold-pressed, unrefined versions when possible, as they retain more beneficial compounds (like antioxidants and vitamins), but be mindful that such oils may also carry more natural fragrance or plant residues. Dry or Dehydrated Skin Richer oils (like avocado, argan, marula) can help lock in moisture. Layering them over a hydrating serum (with glycerin or hyaluronic acid) is key. Cold-pressed or virgin oils may offer higher levels of essential fatty acids and vitamin E, which assist in moisture retention and barrier repair. My Tip: I often choose argan oil labeled as \u201ccold-pressed and organic\u201d to ensure minimal processing and fewer chemical residues, especially when my cheeks are extremely dry. Sensitive or Eczema-Prone Skin Non-fragrant oils\u2014such as sunflower, safflower, or even \u201ccosmetic grade\u201d mineral oil\u2014are often recommended by dermatologists for their gentleness. Patch testing is crucial: even a certified organic oil can contain natural compounds that irritate sensitive skin (like leftover plant waxes).  Certifications to Look For: Some brands carry a \u201chypoallergenic\u201d label or a National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance, indicating they\u2019re tested or formulated to minimize irritation. Combination Skin Apply lighter oils (like jojoba or rosehip) to oilier zones (T-zone) and richer oils (argan or avocado) on drier areas (cheeks). If you find layering multiple oils cumbersome, try blended oils that balance heavier and lighter varieties  Certification Tip: Use cold-pressed organic face oils and check for labels from reputable bodies (e.g., USDA Organic n the U.S., Soil Association in the U.K., e.g., EcoCert, or COSMOS in EU). This indicates the plants were grown without conventional pesticides or fertilizers, which some believe can reduce irritant risk on acne-prone skin. Pro tip from my experience: \u2022 I have combination skin\u2014an oily T-zone but sometimes dry cheeks. I\u2019ll dab a lightweight oil (like jojoba) on my forehead and nose, then use a richer oil or a blend on the parched areas. \u2022 If \u201corganic\u201d is a priority, look for recognized seals (USDA, Soil Association, EcoCert) and ensure the oil is at least \u201ccold-pressed\u201d or \u201cunrefined\u201d so it retains beneficial nutrients.  Suggests the plants were grown without most synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, which can matter to you if you\u2019re concerned about chemical residues or support more eco-friendly practices. Keep in mind \u201corganic\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically equal \u201cbetter\u201d for sensitive skin\u2014some natural compounds can still irritate. However, many people prefer organic for ethical or environmental reasons. This method helps preserve vitamins, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids that can otherwise degrade under high heat or chemical refining. \u201cExtra virgin,\u201d \u201ccold-pressed,\u201d or \u201cvirgin\u201d often signal less processing, which some find beneficial for maximizing the oil\u2019s natural properties\u2014though it may also mean a stronger natural scent or color. Refined oils go through processes that remove impurities (and sometimes beneficial compounds). They may be less aromatic or less prone to causing allergic reactions from plant residues, but also less nutrient-rich. If you have sensitive or rosacea-prone skin, a refined version may actually be gentler (fewer irritants), despite having fewer nutrients. So it\u2019s about striking the right balance for your skin. If you decide to experiment, these tips can help: 2\u20134 drops are usually enough. After cleansing and applying your usual water-based products (serums, lotions), gently press the oil in. I find patting with fingertips keeps me from overdoing it. If you apply oil first, it may block absorption of humectants on top. Oily/Acne-Prone: Lighter, high-linoleic oils like jojoba, hemp seed, rosehip, or squalane. Dry/Mature: Richer oils like argan, marula, almond, or even olive (if your skin tolerates it). Sensitive/Eczema: Gentle oils like sunflower, safflower, or jojoba\u2014always patch test. Combination: You may apply different oils on different face areas. If you enjoy a scented product, ensure it\u2019s in a low concentration (<0.5%), or choose oils with a naturally mild scent (coconut, rosehip, chamomile). \u2022 Keep oils in a cool, dark place (amber or dark glass bottles help). Certain oils (flaxseed, rosehip, hemp) might benefit from refrigeration to slow oxidation. Retinoids: Apply retinol/tretinoin first, then oil to buffer dryness if needed. Vitamin C: Let the serum absorb before pressing a bit of oil on top (if desired). Sunscreen: Always goes last; do not rely on oils for UV protection. Best Oil to Put on Your Face Overnight If I had to pick one, rosehip oil is fantastic for overnight because it\u2019s relatively light, high in antioxidants, and might support an even skin tone. Argan oil also works well if you have mature skin looking for a subtle anti aging boost. If you have dry or mature skin, oils can seal in moisture and deliver extra nutrients. If you\u2019re acne-prone, choose low-comedogenic oils (like squalane, rosehip, or jojoba) carefully and patch test. Always use oils alongside a water-based product to ensure you\u2019re not just \u201csealing in dryness.\u201d \u201cNatural\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically mean \u201csafe\u201d or \u201ceffective,\u201d so approach face oils with balanced expectations.  Rosehip oil, argan oil, and squalane are top picks. Argan improves elasticity, while rosehip\u2019s mild vitamin A aids in refining texture. If you have mature skin that\u2019s on the drier side, marula oil and argan oil offer rich nourishment, while rosehip seed oilis ideal if you prefer a lighter feel. Many do, in moderation. The consensus: choose an oil suitable for your skin type, patch test, and layer it over standard moisturizers or serums. They can be. Look for gentle options (sunflower, rosehip seed oil), avoid heavy fragrances, and apply lightly. Grapeseed, hemp seed, jojoba oil, and rosehip oil are known for being less likely to clog pores and cause breakouts. It depends on your skin type (or if you have sensitive skin). Some flower oil blends are gentler, while heavier oils might overwhelm oily skin types. Dry or Mature Skin: Heavier oils such as argan oil, marula, avocado oil can deeply moisturize. Oily or Acne-Prone: Lighter, non-comedogenic oils like jojoba, rosehip, hemp seed, or squalane are often safer bets. Sensitive or Eczema-Prone: Soothing, high-linoleic oils like sunflower or safflower may help minimize irritation. Sources & Further Reading Cleveland Clinic \u2013 Are Face Oils Good for Your Skin?

Studies suggest that phthalates, found in most mainstream fragrances, can lower testosterone levels and reduce sperm count, while Lilial has been banned in the EU due to reproductive toxicity concerns. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Working Group (EWG) has identified fragrance formulations as one of the most common triggers for skin allergies and respiratory issues. Unlike mainstream perfumes, natural and non-toxic fragrances prioritize botanical ingredients such as essential oils, plant extracts, and resins. While synthetic perfumes last longer due to added stabilizers, natural perfumes offer a chemical-free alternative, making them ideal for you if you have sensitivities or just seek a cleaner beauty routine.

SHOP KENKO FLOR\u00a0  Image by\u00a0Kenko These are the best clean perfume brands using non toxic ingredients Choosing natural perfumes is a great first step towards a healthier lifestyle. For a complete clean beauty routine, it helps to also use makeup free from harsh chemicals. Check out our guide to the top clean, non-toxic makeup brands for healthy skin With the variety of perfumes on the market, it's not always easy to distinguish natural perfume from artificial ones. It's best to read the label carefully, but be aware that perfume industry is often not required to list all the ingredients. It's best to research the production and sustainability information before purchasing, and to critically question claims made by companies. For example, U.S. regulations allow fragrance formulas to remain proprietary, meaning companies can hide dozens of synthetic chemicals under the single term \"fragrance.\" This lack of transparency makes it harder to avoid harmful ingredients like phthalates and synthetic musks. The European Union, however, enforces stricter fragrance regulations. Companies selling perfumes in the EU must disclose the presence of 26 known allergens, and some ingredients (such as Lilial) have been completely banned due to safety concerns. To ensure you\u2019re choosing a non-toxic perfume, look for certifications such as: EWG Verified \u2013 Ensures transparency and strict health standards. Cradle to Cradle Certified \u2013 Indicates a commitment to environmental and human health safety. Leaping Bunny or PETA-Certified \u2013 Confirms the product is cruelty-free. Cosmos Organic Label etc Another way to check for harmful ingredients is the IFRA Label. Many labels for natural cosmetics also exclude the use of animal ingredients or animal testing, such as the Veganblume Label, cruelty-free international etc.\u00a0 Perfume is made by dissolving aromatic substances in distilled water and alcohol. The alcohol serves to make the fragrance ingredients unfold better. But how much alcohol is in a perfume? Conventional perfume typically consists of at least 80% alcohol and 3-15% perfume oil. Generally, the more perfume oils, the higher quality it is considered to be.\u00a0 Unfortunately, conventional perfume brands often use nature-made fragrances that have been replicated or altered in the lab, that is synthetic ingredients. For example, a study by Eco Test found that harmful ingredients were present in 23 out of 25 perfumes. Similarly, a database investigation by Codecheck found that highly potent allergens and toxic chemicals were present as perfume ingredients in about 47% of all women's perfumes and 37% of all men's perfumes on the market. The most common include carcinogenic and toxic chemicals such as: Synthetic musk Cashmeran Lilal (Butylphenyl Methylpropional) Phthalates: Styrene Parabens and other toxic synthetic blends These substances are difficult to degrade and harmful to both nature and the human body. According to the Federal Environment Agency, these harmful fragrances can enter the body through our breathing and distribute throughout the body, causing inflammation or allergic reactions. For example, animal testing has shown that Lilal can damage the reproductive system. In some cases, exposure to chemicals in synthetic perfumes has been linked to cancer risks. UV filters such as Benzophenone-3 or Ethylhexyl also pose a risk to health and can negatively impact the hormonal system. Safe perfumes are usually made from natural fragrance oils and ingredients and contain no harmful chemicals. This includes natural perfumes and organic perfumes made from essential oils, plant absolutes, and resins. Natural perfumes also exclude harmful ingredients such as phthalates and synthetic musk, and they often have certifications such as the Cosmos Organic Label. So what are the advantages of natural perfumes compared to most perfumes? Natural non toxic perfume completely avoids artificial ingredients and preservatives and instead relies on natural fragrance oils and essences, such as extracts from citrus fruits, spices, leaves, flowers, seeds, or resins. Synthetic perfume fragrances generally last longer, but you can apply organic perfume as often as you like, as it is completely free of chemicals. In addition, sustainable scents are becoming better in their fragrance quality and versatility due to the ongoing work of natural perfumers. No specific references were provided in the original text, but there is much research available on the topic of the potential health effects of synthetic fragrance ingredients. Now you know the main advantages of natural non toxic perfume and know the best perfume brands ! Perfumery without chemicals is not only healthier and more environmentally friendly, but also gives you a beautiful natural radiance. So, use up or give away your old synthetic fragrances and start using natural fragrances. Natural fragrances are also always a great and thoughtful gift.

One wrong ingredient, and your face is burning, breaking out, or flaring up in redness. Finding products that calm instead of aggravate can feel impossible. That\u2019s why I was so intrigued by Pai Skincare*\u2014a brand built specifically for sensitive, reactive, and eczema-prone skin with organic, cruelty-free, and vegan formulas. In this Pai Skincare review, I want to share my experiences with the brand's products and if they live up to the brand's promise of calmer skin, reduced redness, and a healthy glow. After testing a full routine, researching the science behind their ingredients, and reading countless reviews, I\u2019m here to give you the most thorough Pai Skincare review. If you\u2019re wondering whether Pai is worth the investment, you\u2019re in the right place.  Pai Skincare* was created by Sarah Brown, who developed chronic urticaria (hives) and found even so-called \u201chypoallergenic\u201d skincare to be full of irritants. Instead of accepting defeat, she built Pai\u2014a line dedicated to calming, strengthening, and protecting sensitive skin. Unlike many brands that use \u201cnatural\u201d as a vague marketing term, Pai backs it up with strict clean beauty certifications: Certified Organic (Soil Association & COSMOS) 100% Vegan & Cruelty-Free (Leaping Bunny & Vegan Society) B Corp Certified (meaning they meet high social and environmental standards) Independently Patch Tested for Eczema-Prone Skin Pai also makes everything in-house at their London facility. This means complete control over quality, from sourcing ingredients to final formulations. If you have reactive, redness-prone, or dry skin, this level of transparency is rare\u2014and reassuring.  One of the things I love most about Pai is their thoughtful approach to ingredients. Every formula is built around botanicals that soothe, hydrate, and support the skin barrier and is free from parabens, sulfates, mineral oils, and synthetic fragrances. By focusing on beneficial plant extracts and essential fatty acids, Pai products support the skin\u2019s microbiome without triggering sensitivity and are suitable for a variety of skin concerns, including dry skin, rosacea-prone skin, and oily skin. Rosehip Oil \u2013 Packed with vitamin A, omega fatty acids, and antioxidants, rosehip face oil supports cell renewal, brightens skin, and may help diminish fine lines and scars. Chamomile \u2013 Naturally rich in bisabolol and chamazulene, chamomile calms redness, soothes irritation, and helps with rosacea. Jojoba Oil \u2013 Mimics the skin\u2019s natural sebum, making it a perfect non-clogging moisturizer for both dry and acne-prone skin. \"it can also help with eczema, psoriasis and sunburns,\u201d according to Cleveland Clinic dermatologists\u200b PHAs (Polyhydroxy Acids) \u2013 A gentle alternative to AHAs, PHAs exfoliate without irritation, making them ideal for sensitive skin. Copaiba Resin & Zinc \u2013 A clinical trial in 2012 found that a 1% copaiba oil preparation led to a \u201chighly significant decrease\u201d in acne lesions on the skin\u200b. The Copaiba Resin & Zinc duo reduces inflammation and balances oil production, making Pai\u2019s acne solutions effective yet gentle. Bottom Line: Pai\u2019s formulas are anchored in dermatological science and traditional herbal wisdom, giving them a strong reputation for truly caring for delicate skin.  Because my skin freaks out easily, I always introduce new products slowly. Over several weeks, I tried almost a full Pai Skincare routine: The Light Fantastic* Viper\u2019s Gloss* Rosehip BioRegenerate Oil * Double Cleanser (Middlemist Seven* + Light Work Rosehip Cleansing Oil*) Feather Canyon Echium & Argan Eye Cream* (my personal favorite name discovery!) Rosehip BioRegenerate Oil * With all the buzz around rosehip, I had to try Pai\u2019s bestseller. It\u2019s become a staple in my evening routine\u2014I adore how my skin looks plumper and calmer by morning. Feather Canyon Echium & Argan Eye Cream*: If you have sensitive eyes like me, you know how risky eye creams can be. This one feels creamy yet delicate thanks to its natural ingredients. No stinging, no watery eyes\u2014just a nice, hydrated under-eye area. Double Cleanse: This set has a cream and an oil-based cleanser. After a long day (especially if I\u2019m wearing heavier makeup), I start with the oil, then follow with the cream. My skin feels clean but never stripped. The Light Fantastic* & Viper\u2019s Gloss*: Both are designed to brighten and nourish. My skin didn\u2019t show immediate dramatic changes, but after a few weeks, I noticed a subtle glow and smoother texture. To truly see how Pai performs, I tested a full routine over several weeks. Here\u2019s what I used and how it worked for my easily irritated, combination skin.  No cleanser here! Why? I share my thoughts on this in my non toxic beauty routine . The Light Fantastic* Ceramide Oil \u2013 A daytime barrier-strengthening oil that sinks in beautifully. Hyaluron Serum \u2013 I use a skin boosting hyaluronic acid in my morning routine to lock in hydration. Let me know in the comments if you're interested in which one! Rosehip BioRegenerate Oil *\u2013 Just 2-3 drops pressed into damp skin left me with a healthy glow and noticeably softer texture. It\u2019s \"dry\" enough not to leave a greasy film, yet nourishing enough for plumper, calmer-looking skin. Feather Canyon Echium & Argan Eye Cream* \u2013 Hydrates without heaviness or milia. A rare non-irritating eye cream that works under makeup too. Personal Note: I\u2019ve personally noticed that since using Rosehip BioRegenerate in the morning, my cheeks look less red and more balanced throughout the day. Double Cleanse: Light Work Rosehip Cleansing Oil* + Middlemist Seven*Cream Cleanser \u2013 I start with the Light Work Rosehip Cleansing Oil to break down SPF, makeup, and impurities. It melts away everything without clogging pores and emulsifies beautifully with water. Then, I follow up with the Middlemist Seven Cream Cleanser to remove any remaining residue and provide a gentle, nourishing cleanse. This two-step process ensures my skin is thoroughly clean without feeling stripped. Hyaluron Serum \u2013 A must-have in my routine to keep my skin plump and hydrated overnight. This lightweight serum locks in moisture and preps my skin for deeper nourishment. Viper\u2019s Gloss* Echium & Amaranth Oil\u2014This rich night oil is loaded with omegas to deeply nourish and repair the skin barrier. I\u2019ll add a drop or two for anti-aging and smoothing benefits. My sensitive skin handles it well, and it helps minimize fine lines from dryness. I wake up with plump, calm skin. Feather Canyon Echium & Argan Eye Cream*: Pai Skincare\u2019s non\u2013irritating eye cream contains antioxidant tri-berries, which help to reduce fine lines and dark circles. It hydrates without heaviness or milia, keeping the under-eye area soft and refreshed. Rosehip BioRegenerate Oil *\u2013 As my last step, I press 2-3 drops of this powerhouse oil into my skin to lock in all the hydration and nourishment from my routine. It helps calm any redness overnight and gives my skin a refreshed, even tone by morning. Personal Note: I always massage\u00a0my\u00a0face\u00a0after applying my evening skincare to stimulate circulation and activate collagen production. This\u00a0simple step\u00a0makes a noticeable difference over time Less redness \u2013 My usual irritation around my cheeks and neck area had calmed significantly. Hydrated, softer skin \u2013 my skin felt stronger overall. Balanced, non-reactive complexion \u2013 I have a very sensitive skin and had zero breakouts or congestion from these products. More even skin tone\u2014Rosehip oil is supposed to have given my skin a natural glow and made it look brighter. Overall, my verdict is that I saw calmer, less blotchy skin and none of the dryness I usually get in harsh weather. These products fit seamlessly into my life\u2014there are no complicated steps and no hidden irritants. As someone with sensitive skin and rosacea, Pai is a holy grail for me. I\u2019ve tested multiplePai Skincare products (but not all of them), and here are my top 2 absolute essentials: Feather Canyon Echium & Argan Eye Cream*: It\u2019s rare for me to find an eye cream that doesn\u2019t sting, and this one is a dream. Echium seed oil is said to contain stearidonic acid, soothing dryness and fine lines around the eye area. Rosehip BioRegenerate Oil * If you could only buy one Pai item, I\u2019d choose this. It\u2019s balanced enough for everyday use, addresses dryness and mild scarring, and adds a subtle glow. Why They\u2019re Perfect: My skin is super sensitive, and these two items never cause reactions or congestion. They\u2019re also easy to layer with the rest of my routine!  For me, absolutely. After years of struggling with unpredictable skin, Pai has given me a routine I trust. It\u2019s gentle, effective, and truly enjoyable to use. My skin feels stronger, more even, and consistently hydrated. Genuine Sensitive-Skin First Philosophy: From brand inception to in-house patch testing, Pai is designed for those of us who react to almost everything, making them suitable for very sensitive skin. Ethical & Sustainable: Certified organic, cruelty-free, vegan, and B Corp achievements, plus sustainable, zero-plastic packaging. Science-backed and clinically proven Formulations \u2013 Chamomile, rosehip, jojoba, and PHAs offer proven soothing and mild exfoliation benefits. Real Results: Pai\u2019s products work. My combination of Double Cleanse and Rosehip Oil has minimized my redness and dryness. Over time, my skin has become noticeably calmer, healthier, and more resilient. Customizable Routine \u2013 Whether you have dry skin, rosacea, or an oily complexion, Pai has a flexible range of products that can be tailored to your needs. If you\u2019re tired of playing roulette with so-called \u201cgentle\u201d skincare, Pai offers a reliable path. Yes, it\u2019s a premium brand, but considering the quality ingredients, ethical standards, and long-lasting products, it\u2019s worth every penny. Book that free consultation\u2014there\u2019s no catch, and you leave with a tailor-made list of products that actually work. Start with a couple of staples (like the Rosehip BioRegenerate Oil and a gentle cleanser) and see how your skin responds. Chances are, you\u2019ll find yourself in the same boat as me\u2014loving the calm, healthy glow that Pai delivers day after day. I highly recommend Pai Skincare* if: You have sensitive, reactive, or redness-prone skin You want organic, cruelty-free skincare You need hydration without irritation You\u2019re looking for vegan products without synthetic fillers If your skin tolerates strong actives like retinol and high-dose acids, you might find Pai too gentle. But if you\u2019re looking for calm, balanced, and naturally healthy skin, Pai is one of the best investments you can make.  Yes, Pai Skincare is highly regarded for its organic, cruelty-free, and vegan formulations designed specifically for sensitive skin. The brand uses science-backed ingredients like chamomile, rosehip, and PHAs to soothe and support the skin barrier. No, Pai Skincare is a British skincare brand founded in London, UK by Sarah Brown in 2007. It is known for its certified organic, sensitive-skin-friendly formulations made in-house. Pai Skincare was founded and is owned by Sarah Brown, who created the brand after struggling with chronic urticaria (hives) and sensitive skin. She remains deeply involved in product development and company ethics. Pai\u2019s Rosehip BioRegenerate Oil is rich in vitamin A, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids, helping to fade scars, even out skin tone, reduce redness, and deeply hydrate. It also supports skin repair and improves elasticity over time. Yes, rosehip oil is safe for daily use and can be applied morning and evening. Its lightweight texture absorbs easily and hydrates without clogging pores, making it suitable even for oily or acne-prone skin. Yes, Pai Skincare is a clean beauty brand, meaning it is free from synthetic fragrances, parabens, sulfates, and silicones.

These ingredients are not only safe but also nourish and moisturize your lips. When choosing a lipstick, it's important to be aware of toxic ingredients commonly found in cosmetic products. Some of the most prevalent harmful ingredients to keep your eye out for include: Parabens (e.g., Methylparaben, Propylparaben) Fragrance (or Parfum) Phthalates (e.g., Dibutyl Phthalate, DEP, DBP, DEHP) Lead Acetate Formaldehyde Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA) Petrolatum Dimethicone Toluene Titanium Dioxide FD&C and D&C (synthetic colorants derived from coal tar, e.g., FD&C Red No. 6) Cadmium Mercury Understanding the ingredients in your lipstick is crucial for maintaining both beauty and health. Some lipsticks contain harmful chemicals that can be absorbed through the delicate skin of the lips and enter your bloodstream and of course can also be ingested. Here are some specific toxic ingredients commonly found in lipsticks and the health risks they are linked to: Synthetic Fragrances: Non-toxic perfume is the most obvious swap when avoiding synthetic fragrances, but they are sneaked into even the most inconspicuous of beauty products. Often not regulated, they can cause hormone disruption, skin rashes, and migraines. The lack of regulation means consumers are often unaware of what they are exposed to. Petroleum and Other Petroleum-Based Products: Products like mineral oil and paraffin can clog pores and may cause premature aging. There are also concerns about their potential carcinogenic properties due to contamination with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Lead: A neurotoxin often found in lipsticks, lead can be harmful even at small doses. Lead exposure is linked to neurological issues, hormonal imbalances, and various other health problems. Heavy Metals: Apart from lead, lipsticks may contain other toxic metals like cadmium, arsenic, and mercury. These metals can accumulate in the body over time and pose significant health risks, including neurological damage and reproductive issues. Titanium Dioxide: Commonly used in cosmetics like lipsticks for its bright, white color, titanium dioxide in nanoparticle form raises concerns, especially regarding inhalation risks and potential skin absorption. It is a classified Group 2B carcinogen. Parabens: Used as preservatives, parabens can disrupt hormone function and have been linked to breast cancer and reproductive issues. They mimic estrogen and can lead to hormonal imbalances. Phthalates: Commonly used in cosmetics, phthalates are linked to reproductive and developmental harm. They are endocrine disruptors and can affect the hormonal system. Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde-Releasing Preservatives: These are used to prevent microbial growth in cosmetics but are known carcinogens. They can also cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. Colorants (such as Coal Tar Dyes): Synthetic colorants derived from coal tar contain heavy metals and can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. They are also suspected to be carcinogenic. Siloxanes (like Cyclomethicone and ingredients ending in \u2018-siloxane' or \u2018-methicone'): Used to soften, smooth, and moisten, siloxanes can be endocrine disruptors and reproductive toxicants. Toluene: A solvent used to improve the look and feel of lipstick, toluene is toxic to the brain and nervous system and may affect development. By avoiding these harmful chemicals, you can reduce your risk of adverse health effects and choose safer alternatives for your clean beauty routine. Despite being a toxic metal, lead can be found in trace amounts in several mainstream lipstick brands. Brands such as Maybelline, Revlon, L'Or\u00e9al, Cover Girl, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Dior, Mac, and Avon have been identified in studies and reports for containing varying levels of lead. Lead is often present as a contaminant from color additives or other raw materials used in the production of lipsticks. The FDA monitors the levels of lead in cosmetics, including lipsticks, and has set guidance levels to minimize exposure. However, even at trace levels, there is concern among health professionals and consumers regarding the potential impact of lead exposure over time, especially considering that lip products are ingested in small amounts during wear. Lipstick with natural ingredients, crafted without additives like titanium dioxide, parabens, and phthalates, typically features plant-based oils, waxes, and fruit pigments. These lipsticks are devoid of synthetic chemicals and harmful additives, offering a healthier option for both your body and the environment. \u00a0 Organic lipsticks represent a significant step forward in clean beauty, going beyond the benefits of natural lipsticks by adhering to stringent organic standards in both ingredient sourcing and production. This distinction ensures that every component used in these lipsticks is not only derived from natural sources but also cultivated and processed according to rigorous organic guidelines. Here are some key aspects that set organic lipsticks apart: Strict No-Use of Harmful Chemicals: In the cultivation of organic ingredients, there is a strict prohibition on the use of pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizers. This approach reduces environmental pollution and minimizes the risk of harmful chemical residues in the final product. Sustainable Farming Practices: Organic lipstick ingredients are often sourced from farms practicing sustainable agriculture. These methods emphasize soil health, biodiversity, and ecological balance, ensuring that farming has a minimal environmental footprint. Non-GMO Ingredients: Organic products, including lipsticks, are typically made from non-genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This means the plants used for ingredients are grown from traditional seeds and cultivated without genetic engineering. Enhanced Quality and Purity: Due to the stringent standards governing organic products, the ingredients used in organic lipsticks often boast higher purity and quality, potentially offering better nourishment and care for the lips. Certification and Transparency: Organic lipsticks usually come with certifications from recognized organic standards bodies, which helps consumers identify and trust their organic claims. These certifications often require rigorous testing and documentation to ensure the product's integrity. Look for certifications like USDA, ECOcert or other Organic certifications Utilize online tools like Clearya,\u00a0ThinkDirty, or Skin Deep to check the safety of ingredients in cosmetics. Look for seals and certifications such as MADE SAFE, which indicate the product has been screened for harmful ingredients. Refer to top toxic ingredient lists to avoid products containing dangerous chemicals. Use fewer products and choose those with simpler, more natural ingredients. Always read product labels to understand what's in your cosmetics. Be wary of vague terms like \u201cfragrance,\u201d which can hide a multitude of potentially harmful chemicals. Choose brands that are transparent about their ingredients and manufacturing processes. Brands that openly share information about their formulations are often more trustworthy. Before fully using a new product, do a patch test to ensure you don't have an allergic reaction, especially if you have sensitive skin. Opt for products with sustainable and safe packaging. Avoid plastics that contain BPA or other harmful chemicals, and look for products in glass or eco-friendly packaging. The world of clean beauty is constantly evolving. Stay informed about new research, ingredients, and brands to continuously refine your choices. If a product doesn't feel right or causes irritation, discontinue use, even if it's labeled as natural or organic. Your body's reaction is a key indicator of whether a product is suitable for you. Safety First: Always check the ingredients and opt for products with natural, organic components. Certifications Matter: Look for products with reputable certifications like MADE SAFE or EWG Verified. Avoid Harmful Chemicals: Steer clear of lipsticks containing synthetic fragrances, lead, and petroleum-based products. Embrace Natural Beauty: Opt for products that enhance your natural beauty while being kind to your skin and the environment. \u00a0 If you enjoyed this post, check out these other articles on safe products and non-toxic living: How to Avoid Pfas in Cosmetics While there are legitimate concerns about the health risks associated with certain ingredients in conventional lipsticks, there are also many brands that offer healthier alternatives made with natural and organic ingredients. Avoid lipsticks with harmful chemicals for the safest experience and consider choosing products with non-toxic, natural ingredients. Opt for products with transparent ingredient lists and safety certifications. Organic lipsticks are generally safe as they are made from natural ingredients grown without harmful pesticides or chemicals. These natural ingredients include organic oils, plant-derived waxes, and earth minerals, which are known for their moisturizing, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. The safest lipsticks are those made from natural, non-toxic ingredients, and preferably with organic certification. When choosing the safest lipstick, it's important to consider personal preferences for texture, finish, and color, as well as the brand's commitment to clean, non-toxic ingredients and ethical practices. The brands listed above in the article offer a variety of options that cater to different needs while ensuring safety and quality. Wearing lipstick every day is fine if you're using products with safe, nourishing ingredients. It's also beneficial to give your lips a break from lipstick occasionally to prevent any potential adverse effects Herbal lipsticks, made with natural plant-based ingredients, are typically safe and can be beneficial for your lips. When selecting herbal lipsticks, prioritize products with organic certifications and avoid toxic substances commonly found in traditional cosmetics. *The links are so-called 'affiliate links.'

Learn more \u2192 Have you ever woken up feeling groggy, congested, or just not well-rested\u2014despite getting a full night\u2019s sleep? What if your mattress, the very thing meant to provide comfort and support, is actually working against you? We spend abouta third of your life in bed\u2014roughly\u00a020 to 26 years! But while we obsess over clean eating and exercise, we rarely stop to think about\u00a0what we\u2019re inhaling and absorbing while we sleep. Toxins in mattresses can off-gas right where you rest your head, potentially causing a range of short- and long-term health issues. Did you know that most conventional mattresses are crafted from synthetic foams, PVC and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and chemical flame retardants - all of which pose significant health risks? In this article, we'll look into the common toxic chemicals found in mattresses, how they can impact your health, and what you can do to create a cleaner, non-toxic living and sleeping space.  Some of the common culprits, that may be making your mattresses toxic include... Most conventional mattresses, especially those made with polyurethane (PU) foam or memory foam, can off-gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These are introduced during manufacturing and may release into your bedroom for weeks or months after unpacking. Although the strongest off-gassing usually subsides within the first few days, low-level emissions can persist longer. Common VOCs in synthetic foams include: Propylene oxide: A potential neurotoxin and irritant Toluene diisocyanate (TDI): A respiratory irritant that can cause asthma-like symptoms Benzene: A known carcinogen Formaldehyde: A cancer-linked adhesive and fabric treatment found in some mattresses The VOCs that are introduced during the manufacturing process are then released into your bedroom, sometimes for years, so knowing how to remove VOCs is crucial! Off-Gassing Warning: Short-term exposure to concentrated VOCs can lead to headaches, dizziness, and respiratory irritation. For sensitive individuals\u2014like those with asthma or multiple chemical sensitivity\u2014these irritations can be more severe. \u27a1\u00a0Solution:\u00a0Choose a\u00a0low-VOC certified\u00a0mattress (CertiPUR-US,\u00a0GOTS, or\u00a0GOLS\u00a0certified) and allow your mattress to off-gas in a well-ventilated room for\u00a048\u201372 hours\u00a0before sleeping on it To meet fire safety regulations, many mattress manufacturers add\u00a0chemical flame retardants, but at a cost to your health. Until\u00a02009, most mattresses contained\u00a0PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers)\u2014now banned due to links to\u00a0hormone disruption, cancer risk, and lower IQ in children. However,\u00a0PBDEs have been replaced\u00a0with newer\u00a0organophosphate-based flame retardants, which\u00a0can still affect the endocrine system\u00a0(EWG Report). Other flame retardants to watch for: \u2022 Organophosphate-based flame retardants (linked to endocrine disruption). \u2022 Fiberglass as a flame barrier (can cause skin and respiratory irritation if fibers escape), EPA warns about long-term exposure. \u2022 Antimony (Found in 23% of tested mattresses) or boric acid in batting layers (both have potential toxicity if frequently inhaled or ingested) If your mattress is 10+ years old, be aware it might contain banned PBDEs. Modern mattresses may replace PBDEs with other flame-retardant chemicals or materials\u2014some safer than others. I.e. modern mattresses use fibreglass as a fire barrier, which can lead to rashes and respiratory irritation. \u27a1\u00a0Solution:\u00a0Look for\u00a0mattresses with natural fire barriers, like\u00a0wool\u00a0or\u00a0silica-treated rayon, instead of chemical-based flame retardants. High-quality foam and fabric shouldn\u2019t contain heavy metals\u2014especially if they carry CertiPUR-US or OEKO-TEX certifications. Yet, certain older or lower-quality mattresses may have dyes and additives containing metals like antimony, mercury, or lead. Over time, exposure to these metals can lead to neurological issues or developmental delays in children. \u27a1\u00a0Solution:\u00a0Stick to\u00a0OEKO-TEX\u00a0or\u00a0CertiPUR-US certified mattresses, which are tested for heavy metals (CertiPUR-US FAQ). PFAS, sometimes called \u201cforever chemicals,\u201d are used for stain-resistant or water resistance properties. If your mattress claims to repel liquids or resist stains, there\u2019s a good chance it contains PFAS. These chemicals: \u2022 Do not break down in the environment (or in the body). \u2022 Have been linked to hormonal imbalances, immune suppression, and certain cancers. In response to growing health concerns, some U.S. states have begun banning PFAS in bedding and juvenile products. \u27a1\u00a0Solution:\u00a0Avoid mattresses labeled as\u00a0\u201cstain-resistant\u201d\u00a0or\u00a0\u201cwaterproof\u201d\u00a0unless they explicitly state\u00a0PFAS-free(California AB 1817). You've probably heard of phthalates in relation to plastics, but did you know they are commonly found in waterproof mattress covers and synthetic components? They\u2019re known endocrine disruptors that can interfere with hormone function, potentially affecting fertility and increasing risk of reproductive issues. \u2022 If a mattress label mentions \u201cvinyl,\u201d \u201cPVC,\u201d or \u201codor control,\u201d it could be a red flag indicating the presence of phthalates or undisclosed chemicals. \u2022 Some children\u2019s products are phthalate-free by law, but adult mattresses may still include them unless otherwise stated. Phtalates often hide under the term \"fragrance\" on labels, so it you see a mattress advertising \"odor control\", its a red flag! \u27a1\u00a0Solution:\u00a0Opt for\u00a0natural materials\u00a0like\u00a0organic cotton, wool, or natural latex\u00a0instead of\u00a0synthetic vinyl covers. Not all cotton mattresses are created equal. Non-organic cotton is one of the most heavily pesticide-treated crops, meaning mattresses and mattress covers may contain pesticides, fungicides and herbicides left over from the growing process - used to prevent pest infestations and mild growth. Residues can linger in cotton batting or fabric, causing skin irritation or allergic reactions\u2014and with prolonged exposure, potentially more severe health outcomes, like neurotoxicity and increased risks of cancers. \u27a1\u00a0Solution:\u00a0Choose\u00a0GOTS-certified organic cotton, which is grown without synthetic pesticides.  Absolutely! Over time, the chemicals in your mattress can migrate from the bed into the air and dust in your bedroom, which you inhale night after night. Depending on your sensitivity and the types of chemicals present, you may face: Respiratory Issues: VOCs and certain flame retardants can trigger respiratory problems like asthma and allergy flare-ups. Allergic Reactions & Skin Sensitivities: Chemical finishes on fabrics can cause rashes or itching, especially in individuals prone to contact dermatitis. Hormonal Disruption - Flame retardants (like PBDEs) and synthetic chemicals used in mattresses can interfere with the endocrine system, potentially leading to hormonal imbalances, and even impacting fertility and Cancer and immune system suppression - Prolonged exposure to flame retardants and certain VOCs (like formaldehyde) has been linked to increased cancer risk and reduced immune function. Ever wake up feeling groggy or battling unexplained headaches? It might not just be your sleep schedule\u2014it could be your mattress. While not all synthetic materials are equally hazardous, certain signs can indicate a toxic mattress: Strong Chemical Smell (Off-Gassing): If that \u201cnew mattress smell\u201d lingers for weeks, you\u2019re likely breathing harmful VOCs. Frequent Headaches, Allergies, or Respiratory Issues: Notice these symptoms worsen at night or upon waking? Your mattress could be releasing irritants. Older Mattresses (10+ Years): Mattresses made before PBDE bans (around 2009 in the U.S.) may contain these now-banned flame retardants. Wear-and-tear can also release more foam dust over time. Label Red Flags: Look for terms like \u201cpolyurethane foam,\u201d \u201cvinyl cover,\u201d or \u201cflame retardant chemicals.\u201dAbsence of third-party certifications may also be a red flag. Note, that brands that offer \"budget-friendly\" and \"luxury memory foam\" mattresses often rely on synthetic materials! These materials are more likely to \"off-gas\" into your sleeping environment.  Organic Natural Latex Mattresses - made from natural rubber, are breathable and completely free from VOCs. However, be cautious of synthetic latex, which is marketed as 'eco-friendly' but still contain VOCs. If choosing latex look for GOLS-certified latex Brands like Naturepedic and Avocado Green offer the best organic mattresses with GOLS-certified organic latex! Organic cotton and Wool Mattresses - Naturally flame-resistant, moisture wicking, and free from synthetic chemicals! This is a great choice for sensitive sleepers Pro Tip: If you're looking for a safer mattress, avoid anything labeled \"memory foam\" unless its CertiPUR-US certified and verified to be free or VOCs and formaldehyde Not all organic claims are legit, so check for third-party sustainability certifications that verify a mattress is truly non-toxic: GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) - ensures cotton and wool are certified organic and free from harmful chemicals GOLS (Global Organic Latex Standard) - Guarantees that latex is at least 95% organic; Bans 350+ chemicals, but allows 5% synthetics OEKO-TEX - Tests for harmful substances in textiles and foams CertiPUR-US - Verifies that foam-based mattresses are free from formaldehyde, heavy metals and ozone depleters. Doesn\u2019t test for PFAS/flame retardant GREENGUARD Gold Pro Tip: Combine certifications (e.g., GOTS + GREENGUARD Gold) for comprehensive protection!  If tossing out your mattress isn't an option, do not worry! There are plenty or practical steps you can take right now to reduce your exposure and create a healthier sleep environment. Use an organic cotton or latex mattress topper as a protective shield between you and your mattress! It helps reduce direct exposure to chemicals, and provides you with extra comfort. GOTS-certified organic cotton or wool toppers are your best bet! By opting for natural fibres instead of synthetic ones that shed microplastics! Let your new mattresses off-gas in a well-ventilated room - Just bought a new mattress? Resist the urge to sleep on it immediately. Instead place it in a well-ventilated area- ideally outside or near a window for at least 48-72 hours. This helps release VOCs before they settle in your bedroom Use an air purifier with activated carbon to reduce VOC exposure - Sadly VOCs do not just disappear on their own, they float around until removed.  A HEPA air purifier with an activated carbon filter can help trap and neutralize VOCs, making the air in your bedroom safer and cleaner! Studies have found air purifiers have been found to reduce VOC concentrations by over 50%! Detox your room with plants - my room is full of them, I can't recommend them enough for cleaner air! Addpeace Lillies, snake or spider plants - plants are natural air purifiers and add a touch of green to your room too Detox Routine: Wash bedding weekly in hot water to remove dust toxins Choose non-toxic bedding (organic cotton or bamboo) - If you're still sleeping on polyester or synthetic bedding, it's time for an upgrade. Traditional bedding often contains chemicals from dyes, pesticides, and flame retardants. Instead, opt for more sustainable materials and non-toxic fabric like bamboo or linen or organic cotton sheets that are free from harmful substances and gentle on your skin! Why not read our article on non-toxic bedding brands to help guide you on your hunt for your next sustainable bedding set! Replace pillows and mattress covers with chemical-free alternatives - Your pillow is right next to your face all night, so making the switch to non-toxic pillows is a great way to limit chemical exposure. Look for non-toxic fabric like organic latex, wool or kapok fibre, and replace synthetic pillows with GOTS-certified organic cotton when possible! Switch out your nightwear - I recently made the switch to more natural fibre, and now wear organic cotton pjs. If you're unsure where to start, look for GOTs-certified clothing, this will ensure the fabric is deemed high-quality and non-toxic.  Most Conventional Mattresses Contain Hidden Toxins\u2014from VOCs and flame retardants to heavy metals and PFAS. Health Risks Include respiratory irritation, skin sensitivities, hormonal disruption, and even increased cancer risk with prolonged exposure. Red Flags: Strong off-gassing smell, older (pre-2009) mattresses with PBDEs, and labels listing polyurethane foam, vinyl covers, or unregulated flame retardants. Safer Options: Look for organic latex, cotton, or wool mattresses certified by GOTS, GOLS, OEKO-TEX, or CertiPUR-US. Interim Solutions: Use organic mattress toppers, air purifiers with activated carbon, and frequent bedding wash routines if you can\u2019t immediately replace your mattress. Yes, toxins in mattresses are a legitimate concern\u2014it\u2019s unsettling to think that where we rest each night could harbor flame retardants, plasticizers, or synthetic off-gassing chemicals. But by staying informed and making small, intentional changes (like adding an organic topper or switching to non-toxic sheets), you can significantly reduce your exposure and wake up feeling more refreshed and confident about your health. If you\u2019re shopping for a new mattress, research certified non-toxic models that rely on safe, natural materials.  Mattress off-gassing can cause irritation in sensitive individuals, including headaches, dizziness, and respiratory issues. Although VOCs typically dissipate within days, prolonged exposure might exacerbate conditions like asthma. Ventilation for at least 24 hours is recommended to minimize the risks. Yes, many conventional mattresses contain harmful chemicals such as VOCs, flame retardants (e.g., PBDEs, organophosphates), PFAS, and heavy metals. These substances can lead to health issues ranging from respiratory irritation to hormonal disruption. Symptoms of exposure to toxic mattress chemicals include respiratory issues, allergic reactions, skin sensitivities, headaches, and hormonal imbalances. Prolonged exposure may also increase cancer risk and suppress immune function. No, not all mattresses contain PFAS. However, some stain-resistant or water-repellent mattresses may include these \"forever chemicals.\" Mattresses can emit VOCs for weeks or even months after purchase, though the strongest off-gassing typically subsides within the first few days. Low-level emissions may persist longer, especially in poorly ventilated spaces Yes, a bad mattress can cause health issues. Older mattresses may contain banned chemicals like PBDEs, while newer ones might still use VOC-emitting foams or PFAS. Symptoms can range from mild irritations to severe health problems over time. Choosing non-toxic materials and certifications like GOTS or GOLS can mitigate these risks Millie Chamberlain is a passionate medical writer based in London.

Many people enjoy using makeup as a form of self-expression, for confidence, and to enhance their innate beauty. However, examining the ingredient labels of numerous popular cosmetics can be concerning. Commonly, they include potentially harmful ingredients like phthalates, SLS, DEA, TEA,\u00a0among others, that harm your health. In today's world, it's crucial to choose a clean makeup brand that prioritize our skin's health. We've carefully curated a list of amazing natural and non toxic makeup brands that are not only gentle on your sensitive skin but also eco-friendly and cruelty-free! The average woman applies over 168 chemicals to her face daily through cosmetics, according to a study by the Environmental Working Group. These chemicals have been linked to hormone disruption, skin irritation, and even long-term health risks. What's more, the beauty industry's lack of regulation means many brands can claim to be \"natural\" without truly living up to that standard. Fortunately, there's a growing movement towards clean, natural  makeup brands that prioritize your health without compromising on performance. We've carefully curated a list of 15 amazing brands that are super gentle on your skin, good for the planet, and don't test on animals! Clean beauty refers to products made without harmful or toxic ingredients. These products prioritize safety for both consumers and the environment by avoiding substances that may cause health issues or environmental damage. Clean make up brands focus on clean, conscious, and ethically sourced products. Natural beauty products use ingredients derived from nature, such as plants, minerals, or animal-derived substances. These products avoid synthetic chemicals, prioritizing ingredients that come from natural sources. While the term \"natural\" can sometimes be ambiguous, looking for labels such as \"EWG VERIFIED\u2122\" can help you find products that adhere to specific guidelines and criteria that align with natural beauty standards Organic beauty products are made with ingredients that are grown without the use of pesticides, synthetic chemicals, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs), such as plant extracts, mineral pigments, and essential oils. Organic farming practices prioritize soil health, environmental sustainability, cruelty-free practices and eco-friendly packaging and the well-being of both plants and animals. Organic products often carry certifications from reputable organizations, reflecting compliance with established organic standards. By choosing clean, organic, non toxic make up brands, you're treating your skin kindly and also contributing to a healthier planet!

This trend emerged in response to the lack of regulations in the beauty industry and has sparked a heated debate over its definition and the risk of greenwashing. What exactly does \"clean beauty\" mean? And why should you care? You might associate clean beauty with organic products, natural ingredients, and sustainable solutions. While these associations aren't wrong, the term \"clean beauty\" is not clearly regulated, leading to various interpretations. The movement has gained momentum in recent years. According to a Harper's BAZAAR poll, nearly 50% of surveyed women are now using clean beauty products. Clean beauty can be a powerful ally in achieving better, more transparent skincare\u2014if we know how to interpret it correctly. Let's demystify clean beauty to empower ourselves to make conscious decisions about the products we use daily.  Get the Real Scoop: Finally understand what \"clean beauty\" means so you can make smart, informed choices about the products you use every day. Love Your Skin: Say goodbye to irritation and allergies with products that ditch harmful ingredients like parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances. Your skin will thank you! Feel Good About Your Choices: Support brands that care about more than just profits. Look for those that prioritize cruelty-free testing and fair-trade sourcing\u2014because beauty should be kind. Be a Planet Protector: Help save the earth with products that come in eco-friendly packaging and use sustainable ingredients. Small changes can make a big impact! Demand Honesty: Enjoy the peace of mind that comes from knowing exactly what\u2019s in your products. Clean beauty brands are all about transparency, so you\u2019re never in the dark. There is no clear definition of clean beauty, but it generally refers to cosmetic products that prioritize safety, sustainability, ethics, and transparency. This encompasses: Non-toxic ingredients: Excluding harmful substances like parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances. Environmentally conscious packaging: Using recyclable or biodegradable materials. Ethical sourcing and production: Ensuring fair-trade practices and cruelty-free testing. Full ingredient disclosure: Transparency about what goes into the products and why. Clean cosmetics should be \"clean of harmful ingredients,\" such as parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances. However, this doesn't mean they contain 100% natural ingredients. The description of harmful chemicals varies by region due to different regulations. For example, the European Union has banned over 2,500 ingredients in personal care products, while the US FDA lists only 11 chemicals. The term \"clean beauty\" isn't as new as you might think. It first popped up in the 1970s, thanks to Cover Girl and their \"Clean Make-up\" campaign, which championed that fresh-faced, no-makeup look. Fast forward to the early 2000s, and brands like Ren\u2014whose name literally means \"clean\" in Swedish\u2014picked up the baton and ran with it.  The movement gained popularity due to frustration over regulatory oversight of personal care products. It wasn't until the 2020s that it really took off, with many companies using the trendy slogan to describe their products. True clean beauty means a holistic approach that considers not only product formulas but also production, packaging, and promotion. This should encourage brand transparency and inspire trust in customers by eliminating potentially harmful ingredients while considering the well-being of the planet.  Clean beauty offers several potential benefits that align with consumer demands for safer, more ethical, and environmentally friendly products: Safer for Your Skin: Clean products often exclude potentially harmful ingredients like parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances, reducing the risk of skin irritation and allergies. Learn more about ingredients to avoid. Better for the Environment: Many clean beauty brands focus on sustainable packaging and ethically sourced ingredients, helping to reduce environmental impact. Increased Transparency: Clean beauty companies tend to be more open about their ingredients and manufacturing processes, providing consumers with more information to make informed choices. Potentially Gentler on Sensitive Skin: Natural, non-toxic ingredients are less likely to cause irritation or allergic reactions, making them suitable for sensitive skin. Ethical Considerations: Many clean beauty brands prioritize cruelty-free testing and fair-trade sourcing, ensuring that their products are produced ethically. Clean beauty has expanded significantly in recent years. This trend is predicted to gain a higher market share in the beauty industry over the next decade, potentially quadrupling its worth by 2033. What drives the clean beauty movement? While there has been more focus on clean ingredients and \"free-from\" products, we're seeing a shift in consumers' mindsets. It's more than just hype\u2014people are becoming more climate and health-conscious, and this is reflected in their shopping choices. Companies offering sustainable packaging, animal-free testing, and vegan-certified products are increasingly valued. The shift didn't happen overnight. Social media, climate activists, and documentaries like \"Not So Pretty\" * have played a significant role, highlighting the harmful effects of beauty and personal care products. Organizations such as the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), the Environmental Working Group (EWG), and the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics have worked tirelessly to share useful information and classify certain ingredients found in personal care and cosmetic products as harmful and unsuitable for topical use. These efforts impact the industry to create products that are better for your health, skin, and the planet, making your choice easier at a store.  Embracing the clean beauty trend offers multiple benefits for our health and the environment. If you are looking for products with fewer chemicals and preservatives, clean beauty might be the right choice. It offers higher quality and more transparency from producers and retailers. You might be attracted by environmental benefits, ethical and health aspects, which are the core of the clean beauty philosophy. Here\u2019s why you should consider making the switch: Avoid Harmful Ingredients: Ingredients commonly avoided in clean cosmetics, such as MI/MCI, fragrance mix, and formaldehyde, have been proven to harm human health, causing skin irritation, allergies, chronic rashes, or even links to cancer. Benefit from Plant-Based Products: Plant-based products, often found in clean beauty, have a long history of use in traditional medicine and offer dermatological benefits. Avoid Fragrance Risks: Fragrance producers use trade-secret formulas, and the FDA doesn't require these to be listed on labels. Opting for clean products, which are often fragrance-free, can save you from unpleasant consequences. Better Ingredients: Clean beauty brands tend to use better, non-toxic ingredients and promote transparency, helping buyers make informed decisions. The myriad of terms in beauty trends can be mind-boggling, to say the least.Clean beauty, organic beauty and natural beauty are often used interchangeably, but the terms refer to different tendencies in the industry.  Feeling confused? Let's make it all crystal clear. Clean Beauty: Focuses on safety and non-toxicity, including synthetic ingredients if deemed safe. Clean beauty prioritizes the elimination of harmful substances and transparency in ingredient disclosure. You should know by now that the definition of \"clean\" can vary from brand to brand, but the focus stays on safety and non-toxicity rather than the source. Natural Beauty: Uses ingredients sourced from nature. However, natural ingredients aren't necessarily safer or more effective and can include allergens and irritants. What's more, natural doesn't equal organic or vegan\u2014natural cosmetics can include animal derivatives. Organic Beauty: Contains ingredients grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, certified by organizations like USDA Organic or COSMOS. To be considered organic, products must contain at least 95% of organically grown and processed ingredients. Organic beauty is the most regulated of the three, ensuring that products meet specific organic standards. The lack of regulations in both natural and clean beauty means you need to stay vigilant and verify if brands' descriptions of their cosmetics are accurate. The beauty industry has often been called out for its heavy reliance on single-use plastics and pollution. But guess what? Times are changing! As we consumers get smarter and more eco-conscious, brands are stepping up to meet our demands. Today\u2019s clean beauty isn\u2019t just about safe ingredients\u2014it's about sustainability too. This means using eco-friendly packaging and ensuring that products live up to their green promises. While natural ingredients sound great, they\u2019re not always better for your skin or the planet. What really counts is how these ingredients are sourced. Are they ethically harvested? Do they protect biodiversity? Is their production energy-efficient? Look for clean beauty certifications like Ecocert, USDA Organic, or Leaping Bunny. These stamps of approval ensure that your non toxic skincare routine is as kind to the planet as it is to your face. So, next time you shop, remember: sustainability is the new beautiful!  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but safety, credibility, and transparency hold higher value. As the clean beauty trend skyrockets, it becomes harder to identify genuine efforts among \"greenwashing\" and \"cleanwashing\" declarations. Clean beauty has echoed in skincare and made headway in the makeup brands and fragrance industry. Many brands claim to be \"clean\" without facts to support their marketing slogans, and fearmongering is not unheard of. Anyone can call their products \"clean,\" making the right decision tricky. But that's not the only problem\u2014many of the ingredients scrutinized for their safety are changing as companies try to \"cleanwash\" their products to make them more attractive to conscious consumers. How can we recognize \"greenwashing\" before making a wrong choice? Look for Certifications: Labels like EWG Verified or MADE SAFE verify beauty products to meet strict health standards. Understand Terminology: Learn some basic terminology to understand ingredient lists better. Trust Transparent Brands: Clean companies = transparent marketing. Brands like Goop products or Credo, known for its \"Credo Clean Standard,\" advocate for new standards in beauty and offer products made without harmful ingredients. Use Resources: Resources like EWG's app Healthy Living, Think Dirty and other apps help analyze products by searching through its database or scanning a barcode. It's time to reconsider our daily skincare routines. The good news? You don't have to replace all your products at once. If you want to switch to clean beauty for healthier, more transparent, and environmentally-friendly products, here are a few simple steps to follow: Choose Reputable Clean Beauty Brands: Consider starting with reputable and well-known brands, such as Ilia* or 100% Pure*. These brands offer clean makeup including non-toxic lipsticks, clean mascara,\u00a0clean foundations\u00a0or non toxic eye shadows that are gentle on your skin and the planet.

Use resources such as the EWG's Skin Deep ingredient hazard score, which reflects known and suspected hazards linked to the ingredients. Identify and Replace Toxic Ingredients: Take a look at your current cosmetics and skincare products. Research the ingredients to see if they\u2019ve been linked to health problems. Begin replacing products containing toxic ingredients with clean alternatives Clean Moisturizers: Starting your day with non-toxic natural skincare products and use a clean moisturizerto avoid parabens and other harmful chemicals, ensuring your skin stays hydrated and healthy. Clean Haircare: For healthier hair, consider switching to clean haircare products.

Clean beauty encompasses products that are not only free from harmful ingredients but also manufactured ethically and sustainably.

Learn more \u2192 Welcome to a world where our health takes center stage, where every decision we make resonates with the commitment to a non-toxic living. It\u2019s about making conscious decisions to reduce the toxins we consume and create a healthier environment for ourselves and our loved one. As a mother and founder of a company dedicated to sustainable practices, I've learned that the path to a healthier lifestyle begins with us. No one will hand us good health on a silver platter, it's a conscious choice we make every day. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore various facets of non-toxic living, from the candles we light to the clothes our children wear, and how each choice impacts our wellbeing. It's true, this journey may seem a bit complicated at first, but remember, every big change starts with small steps. Each day, we can make choices that bring us closer to a healthier, more connected, and happier lifestyle. Join me as we explore the foundations of non-toxic living, starting with understanding what toxins are and why it's essential to minimize their presence in our lives. Conscious Choices for Health: Prioritize your health and well-being by actively reducing toxins in your daily life. This includes being aware of the hidden dangers in everyday products and making informed decisions to avoid them. Embrace Organic and Natural Options: Opt for organic foods, natural fibers in clothing, and eco-friendly household products. These choices safeguard your health and also contribute to environmental sustainability. Create a Toxin-Free Home Environment: Invest in non-toxic cookware, chemical-free cleaning products, and safe personal care items. Emphasize the importance of a clean living environment for both personal health and ecological well-being.  Image by\u00a0Greta Hoffman An invisible enemy lurks: toxins. They sneak into our lives, hidden in the most unlikely places. Consider your favorite scented candles or the enticing aroma wafting from plug-in scents \u2013 they may contain toxic chemicals, adding an unwelcome twist to their charming fragrances. Even your beloved cooking oil might not be as innocent as it seems. Let\u00b4s learn how to decode confusing product labels, differentiating between genuinely natural products and deceptive alternatives, including cooking oils. The shift requires choosing well-being and safety over convenience and cost. Toxins are substances that can cause harm to our bodies. They come in many forms and can be found in the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the products we use. Toxins can be chemical, physical, or biological, and their effects on health can range from mild irritations to serious diseases. They can affect various biological processes, often targeting the nervous system, and can lead to diseases or even be fatal if ingested or otherwise introduced into the body of another organism.(1, 2 ) Knowing what toxins are and where they come from is the first step in reducing their impact. Remember, knowledge is power. Some toxins are naturally occurring chemicals present in certain foods and water sources. For example, certain fish may contain high levels of mercury, and some plants naturally produce defensive toxins. On the other hand, many toxins are human-made, created for industrial and agricultural purposes. These include chemicals like lead, found in old paints and plumbing materials, and arsenic, occasionally discovered in contaminated groundwater. Pesticides used in agriculture to control pests and enhance crop yields are another significant source of toxins. These chemicals, designed to be potent and durable, can remain as residues on fruits and vegetables, potentially impacting our health when consumed. Radiation, too, is a form of toxin. While natural background radiation is a normal part of our environment, excessive exposure to certain types of radiation can be harmful. Industrial chemicals, such as those used in manufacturing processes, can also be toxic. Suppliers often use these toxins to deliver \u201cbetter\u201d performing products. For example, a more potent weed killer or bug spray, a longer-lasting perfume, or fruits and vegetables that stay fresh for an extended period. While these products may offer short-term convenience and benefits, their long-term impact on health and the environment can be significant, as toxins exert harmful effects on the environment and wildlife. Toxins can affect our health in a multitude of ways, including disrupting hormonal balance and impacting mental health. Long-term exposure to certain toxins has been linked to a range of chronic diseases. Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs): EDCs interfere with hormone functioning and are ubiquitous in the environment. They can disrupt cellular processes at any point in the hormonal cycle, from hormone production to reception in tissues. EDCs have been associated with cancer, heart problems, and reproductive concerns\u200b\u200b. Accumulation in the Body: Studies have found EDCs present in blood, urine, and breast milk, indicating that these chemicals accumulate in our bodies over time due to consistent exposure, even to small amounts\u200b\u200b. Link to Chronic Diseases: There's evidence linking EDCs to various health issues. For instance, DDE, a breakdown product of the pesticide DDT, has been associated with diabetes. EDCs like BPA (found in plastics), phthalates, and arsenic have been shown to affect metabolic disorders like diabetes and obesity. EDCs may also negatively impact cardiovascular health\u200b\u200b. Understanding these different types of toxins, their sources, and their potential effects on our health is the first step toward adopting a non-toxic lifestyle. By being aware of where toxins lurk, we can make more informed choices in our daily lives. In the following sections, we'll explore what it means to live a non-toxic life and how we can reduce our exposure to these harmful substances. Lead a sustainable lifestyle by prioritizing whole foods, buying organic and locally sourced products, and dining at restaurants that prioritize local ingredients. Live non-toxic and reduce your environmental footprint! Living \"toxic-free\" means actively choosing products and lifestyles that minimize exposure to harmful toxins. It's a holistic approach and involves being conscious of the ingredients in our food, the materials in our clothing, and the chemicals in our household products. A toxic-free lifestyle aims to reduce the overall toxic burden on our bodies and the environment. The\u00a0Environmental Working Group. provides valuable resources for identifying toxin-free options. Think of every product you use as a vote. A vote for health or harm. A vote for sustainability or pollution. Choosing non-toxic products is a vote for a healthier, safer world. It\u2019s about swapping your cleaning products laden with chemicals for natural cleaners like baking soda and vinegar. It\u2019s about opting for organic foods free from pesticides. This involves scrutinizing product labels and comprehending their contents. It's about creating a healthier living space, nourishing our bodies with clean food, and using products that are kind to the earth. Let's dive into what it really means to live non-toxically.  Our bodies are the vessels that carry us through life, and what we fuel them with matters. Organic foods offer us the chance to nourish our bodies without the burden of chemicals, pesticides, and growth hormones. Understanding the origins of our food and how it\u2019s grown is fundamental. When it comes to choosing organic, not all fruits and vegetables are created equal. Some carry a heavier load of pesticides than others. That\u2019s where the Dirty Dozen and Clean Fifteen come in. These lists guide us on which fruits and vegetables are most likely to be laden with pesticides and which ones are safer choices. Imagine biting into a juicy apple, knowing it was grown just a few miles away by a farmer you trust. That\u2019s the power of eating locally grown food. Supporting local farmers and shrinking your carbon footprint are additional benefits of this practice.  Imagey by Olga Drach\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash Ever wondered what 'certified organic' or 'natural' really means on a label? 'Certified organic' means strict rules were followed, no synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. For example, biodynamic or certified organic products are often the best options for minimizing toxin exposure. 'Natural' is less regulated, but generally, it's supposed to mean ingredients come from nature. The trick is to know which certifications are trustworthy and prioritize them for a toxin-free life. In our fast-paced world, processed foods have become a staple in many diets. They\u2019re quick, convenient, and often addictive. Yet, they\u2019re also filled with artificial additives and empty calories. Learning to identify and avoid processed foods is a crucial step towards a healthier, non-toxic lifestyle but also to avoid long term health treathing consequences. Here are the summarized straightforward tips: Choose Wisely: Go for biodynamic or buy organic products when you can. If not, look for natural products with some organic ingredients. Next best? Natural and chemical-free. Lastly, if nothing else, pick natural with the least toxins. Learn to Read Labels: Use websites and apps to help you spot and avoid harmful ingredients and those sneaky E numbers. Eat Fresh and Avoid Processed Foods Buy fresh and local from farmers' markets. And remember, it's not about perfection but about making better choices whenever you can.  Image by micheile henderson\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash Just as we nourish our bodies with healthy food, we need to nourish our skin with healthy care. The skin is our body\u2019s largest organ, and it absorbs much of what we put on it, making it vulnerable to absorbing toxins present in everyday products like moisturizers, lotions, makeup, shampoos,\u00a0or face sunscreens. Unfortunately, many personal care products are filled with harmful toxins that can seep into our bodies. Harmful Substances in Conventional Products: Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde-Releasing Preservatives (FRPs): Often added to products like keratin hair straighteners, nail polish, and shampoos for their preservative properties. FRPs slowly release formaldehyde over time, posing health risks\u200b\u200b. Coal Tar: Used in hair dyes, shampoos, and treatments for scalp conditions, coal tar is a known carcinogen derived from coal processing\u200b\u200b. Benzene: Found in some hair conditioners and styling lotions, benzene can be inhaled or ingested and is derived from coal tar\u200b\u200b. Mineral Oils: Common in a wide range of personal care products, these oils are derived from crude oil and often contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are hazardous\u200b\u200b. Ethylene Oxide: Used in the process of ethoxylation in some personal care products, ethylene oxide is a concerning impurity that can cause various cancers\u200b\u200b. Heavy Metals: Substances like hexavalent chromium and cadmium, used as colorants in cosmetics like eye shadow and lip gloss, pose significant health risks\u200b\u200b. (Source Safecosmetics ) But fortunately there are safe, natural alternatives are available.  Fragrances in conventional products often contain toxins. Opting for natural fragrances\u00b4brands can significantly reduce your exposure to harmful sabstances. Clean Brands like Skylar * offer unique and safe scents. Deodorant is something most of us use every day for hygiene, especially when we're active or out and about. After years of searching, I found my go-to favorites: Real Purity Roll-On Natural Deodorant * and Wild - Natural Refillable Deodorant * . These non toxic deodorants have been my trusted choices for years, ensuring I stay fresh and confident without compromising on health and safety. Reducing the amount of makeup you use in your daily skincare routine is a straightforward strategy to minimize exposure to toxins. However, when makeup is essential, opt for clean make up brands that prioritize safe, non-toxic ingredients. These brands often use natural pigments and avoid chemicals like parabens, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances, offering products such as natural non-toxic\u00a0mascaras\u00a0or clean lipsticks that enhance your eyes without irritation and natural foundations that provide coverage while allowing your skin to breathe. By choosing organic options whenever possible, you're not only protecting your skin but also supporting sustainable practices in the clean beauty industry.  The daily ritual is a time for self-care, a moment to pamper ourselves. But the products we use in these rituals could be doing more harm than good, exposing our bodies to a cocktail of harmful chemicals. Making the switch to\u00a0\u00a0toxin free facial wash, non-toxic toothpaste, non toxic\u00a0soap, natural body wash\u00a0and lotions can protect your skin and your health. Look for products that contain nurturing ingredients like coconut oil, aloe vera, and shea butter. These natural components provide deep hydration, improve skin elasticity, and offer vital nutrients. For hair care, steering clear of products like sprays and artificial dyes can significantly reduce your exposure to harmful toxins. Natural hair care options, including shampoos and conditioners or natural hair dyes made with organic and plant-based ingredients, offer a healthier alternative. These products often contain nourishing elements like essential oils, herbal extracts, and vitamins, which help maintain hair health without the adverse effects of synthetic additives.  Image by vadim kaipov auf Unsplash Switching to a toxin-free home is a proactive step towards enhancing your family's health. By choosing non-toxic products, you're guarding against allergies, breathing issues, and chemical sensitivities. From the cleaners you use to your furniture, even natural candles and kids' toys, every non-toxic choice helps. It reduces your environmental impact and supports sustainable living. So, making your home toxin-free is good for you and the planet. Furniture and Health: Conventional furniture often contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, and flame retardants, which can off-gas into your home. The EPA has identified VOCs as contributors to indoor air pollution, which can cause health issues like headaches, dizziness, and respiratory problems. Opting for furniture made with natural, untreated materials can significantly reduce these risks. Mattresses Matter: We spend about one-third of our lives sleeping, so what we sleep on is crucial. Many conventional mattresses contain chemicals like polyurethane foam and flame retardants. A study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology found that people who used mattresses with these materials had higher exposure levels to certain VOCs. Choosing organic or natural mattresses can lower this exposure and improve sleep quality. Bedding and Linens: Similarly, non-organic bedding often contains chemical residues from pesticides and dyes. Non Toxic\u00a0bedding brands\u00a0offering\u00a0organic sheets, made from materials like organic cotton, bamboo, or linen, are the better option than conventiobal ones. They are free from these harmful substances and better for your skin and respiratory health. Children's Products: Choosing non-toxic toys and furniture for kids is crucial in preventing exposure to chemicals that can affect their development. Phthalates, used in plastics, have been linked to hormonal disruptions. Non-toxic, organic toys for children are essential for their safety and development. Did you know that the air inside your home can be up to five times more polluted than the air outside? A health study conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has uncovered potential health risks associated with various deodorizing items such as air fresheners, cleaners for toilet bowls, laundry detergent (sheets) and mothballs, particularly concerning lung health. A study in Environmental Pollution revealed that daily mopping in childcare facilities with certain   PFAS products containing fluorotelomer sulfonates, a type of PFAS, significantly elevates the risk of exposure to these harmful chemicals. This is particularly concerning for young children who often play on the floor.\u00a0  Image\u00a0by\u00a0KINN Living\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash Swap those chemical-laden cleaners for natural alternatives. Understanding that cleaning shouldn\u2019t equate to introducing more toxins into your home is crucial. Air Quality and Cleanliness: The air inside our homes can be more polluted than the air outside due to toxic chemicals in household cleaners. These substances can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air, contributing to indoor air pollution. Environmental Impact: Traditional cleaners often contain chemicals that seep into waterways, affecting wildlife and ecosystems. Many of these products are petroleum-based, further depleting natural resources. Simplifying Cleaning Routines: One effective approach to reducing toxins in your home is to minimize the number of specific cleaning products. A multipurpose cleaner, for instance, can serve various purposes, from mopping floors to cleaning bathrooms and kitchens. This simplification reduces the number of chemicals in your home and also promotes efficiency and sustainability\u200b\u200b. DIY Non-Toxic Cleaners: Making your own cleaning products is easier than you might think. For example, a simple all-purpose cleaner can be made with white vinegar, baking soda, hot water, and a few drops of essential oil for fragrance. This is where the power of natural air purifiers comes into play. Houseplants, for instance, are not just pretty to look at. They\u2019re hard at work, silently cleaning the air, absorbing toxins, and releasing fresh oxygen. Some of the best houseplants for purifying the air include: Spider Plant: Known for its ability to remove harmful chemicals like formaldehyde and xylene. Peace Lily: A beautiful plant that can help reduce levels of mold spores and other airborne contaminants. Snake Plant: Exceptional for filtering out carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen at night, making it ideal for bedrooms. Aloe Vera: Not only is it good for skin, but it also helps eliminate formaldehyde and benzene from the air. Boston Fern: A natural humidifier and air purifier, great for removing formaldehyde. By adding these plants to your home, you can improve the air quality and create a healthier living environment. Water is life, and clean water means health. But how clean is the water you drink? While we often take it for granted, the quality of our water can significantly impact our health. Thankfully, there are numerous ways to ensure clean water for your family, from activated carbon filters to reverse osmosis systems. Choosing a water purification system should be based on your personal needs and the assurance it brings. The kitchen is the heart of the home. It\u2019s where meals are prepared with love, where families gather to share their day. But the kitchen can also be a source of exposure to toxins \u2013 from the cookware and non-stick pans we use to the storage containers we choose. For a toxin-free home, redefining kitchen essentials involves choosing items that safeguard your health. The right cookware can protect your health. Non-stick pans may be convenient, but the chemicals used in their coating can pose health risks. Selecting non-toxic alternatives like stainless steel or cast iron ensures your cookware is a better health-conscious option. Plastic containers may be common, but they\u2019re not always the best choice for food storage. They can leach chemicals into your food, especially when heated. Choosing plastic-free alternatives like glass or stainless steel enables you to store food safely and retain its freshness. What we wear is a reflection of who we are. But it\u2019s also a reflection of our values. The clothes we choose, the fabrics we prefer, all tell a story. But behind the scenes, textile production can have a significant impact on our health and the environment. The use of toxic chemicals in fabric manufacturing is a major concern. These chemicals, ranging from dyes to finishing agents, can seep into our skin, leading to health issues like textile dermatitis. This condition is marked by skin irritation and allergic reactions, often triggered by the chemical residues left in the fabrics.  Understanding the materials and processes behind our garments is key to making informed decisions. Natural Fibers for Health: Natural fibers like organic cotton, linen, and hemp are more than just eco-friendly choices, they're kinder to our skin. Synthetic fibers, on the other hand, can trap moisture and heat, leading to skin irritation and discomfort. Opting for natural fibers ensures breathability and reduces the risk of skin allergies and irritations. The Importance of GOTS Certification: The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is the gold standard for organic textiles. Clothing with a GOTS certification ensures that the entire production process, from the harvesting of raw materials to the final product, adheres to strict environmental and social criteria. By choosing GOTS-certified clothing, you're opting for textiles free from harmful chemicals Chemical-Free Clothing: The chemical treatments used in many clothing manufacturing processes can linger on garments, potentially leading to skin reactions and long-term health issues. Chemical-free clothing\u00a0is produced without these harmful substances, offering a safer alternative for both adults and children. In our journey towards a non-toxic lifestyle, we\u2019ve explored various facets of our daily lives \u2013 from the food we eat to the products we use, from our homes to our food and clothing. We\u2019ve learned that chemical free living comes to making conscious choices that prioritize our health and the health of our planet. It\u2019s about embracing a lifestyle that is sustainable, ethical, and harmonious. It\u2019s about living in a way that leaves a positive impact.

Today, more people are waking up to the fact that conventional beauty products are filled with toxins, from\u00a0parabens to phthalates, which can wreak havoc on your skin and overall well-being. But there\u2019s good news: non-toxic natural skincare products offer a safer, healthier alternative. In this guide, we\u2019ll take you through the best non toxic skincare brands that not only nurture your skin but are also committed to ethical and sustainable practices. Whether you\u2019re seeking certified organic ingredients or brands with sustainable packaging, this curated list is designed to help you to find what you need. Did you know that according to an Environmental Working Group (EWG) study the average person applies over 126 different ingredients during their daily skincare routine? Many of these ingredients in your everyday skincare products are more harm than help. Conventional skincare can often be a chemical cocktail, with ingredients that not only harm your body but also impact the environment. The most concerning ingredients in conventional skin care include: \u2022 Sulfates: Commonly derived from petroleum or palm oil, sulfates can irritate the skin and eyes, and they\u2019re harmful to aquatic life. \u2022 Parabens: These preservatives can disrupt hormone levels, particularly estrogen, and have been linked to reproductive issues and an increased risk of breast cancer. \u2022 Phthalates: Found in everything from lotions to nail polish, phthalates are known to affect reproductive health and development. \u2022 Mineral Oil: This petroleum byproduct can clog pores, trapping toxins in the skin, and may contain carcinogens if not properly refined. \u2022 Formaldehyde: Used as a preservative, formaldehyde is a known carcinogen and can cause allergic skin reactions. \u2022 Phenoxyethanol: A synthetic preservative that can cause skin irritation and has been linked to toxicity in nervous system function when used in large amounts. \u2022 PEGs (Polyethylene Glycols): These chemicals are often contaminated with carcinogenic impurities and are used as thickening agents in many conventional skincare products.  So, why stick with toxic ingredients when there are safer, more effective alternatives? It also begs the question: Shouldn\u2019t non-toxic be the new standard? This concern underscores the significance of making mindful choices in personal care products for ourselves and our families, mirroring the growing preference for products free from harmful chemicals like non-toxic perfumes or non-toxic make up. As we become more aware of the harmful effects of various chemicals in these everyday products, it\u2019s increasingly important to consider the overall impact of our personal care selections embracing non toxic living lifestyle. When selecting skincare products, it\u2019s crucial to read labels carefully and choose those with fewer, recognizable ingredients. Opt for brands that are transparent about their formulations and committed to using safe, natural ingredients.

Shop Pai Skincare here*  Image @ Pai Skincare These were the best natural toxin free skincare brands Navigating the skincare aisle can be tricky, especially with buzzwords like 'natural', 'clean', and 'organic' crowding product labels. This linguistic landscape is often clouded by greenwashing. Understanding them is key to finding products that align with your values and needs, not just those swayed by marketing. Here\u2019s a quick guide to what these terms really mean: \u2022 Natural in skincare typically refers to ingredients derived from nature, without synthetic additives. However, it's crucial to remember that 'natural' isn't a regulated term in the beauty industry and can be used liberally by brands, without standardization. It's essential to look beyond this label, examining the ingredient list for a true understanding of what you're applying to your skin. \u2022 Clean: Products labeled \u201cclean\u201d are made without potentially harmful ingredients like parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances. However, each brand has its own standards, so it\u2019s important to dig into what they exclude. \u2022 Organic: These products are made with ingredients grown without pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. Look for certifications like USDA Organic to be sure. Organic skincare is not only safer for your skin but better for the environment, too.  When it comes to skincare, \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cnon-toxic\u201d are more than just trendy labels. It\u2019s about going beyond a few plant-based ingredients and really embracing a philosophy that prioritizes health \u2014 both yours and the planet\u2019s. The best brands focus on ingredient integrity, but also effectiveness, minimal processing, and ethical practices from start to finish. I always look for certifications like USDA Organic (hello, strict organic standards!), MADE SAFE or EWG verified, which guarantee toxin-free practices. These seals make it easier to spot the brands that truly care about what goes into their products, and just as importantly, what they leave out \u2014 like synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances, and harmful preservatives. Toxin free skincare also often comes with an eco-friendly bonus: sustainable packaging and responsible sourcing. Think less plastic waste and more recycled or biodegradable materials, which is a win for everyone! For me, it\u2019s all about finding skincare that works in harmony with my skin\u2019s natural biology \u2014 especially with my sensitive skin. I want products that are effective at removing makeup, nourishing deeply, and moisturizing without irritation. And knowing they\u2019re kind to the planet? That\u2019s just the glow I need. Non-toxic skincare harnesses the power of nature\u2019s ingredients \u2014 like herbs, essential oils, and butters \u2014 without relying on heavy processing. These brands avoid synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances, and colors, focusing instead on pure, gentle ingredients. Many of natural ingredients have been studied for their beneficial properties, giving them a strong foundation in both tradition and modern research. With minimalistic formulas, the emphasis is on the quality and effectiveness of a few key ingredients, rather than long, complex lists of compounds. This approach makes nontoxic products gentler on the skin, ideal for those with sensitivities or who prefer a more holistic approach to beauty. While natural ingredients are effective, their potency can depend on proper formulation and storage. For instance, vitamin C can degrade quickly when exposed to light or air, reducing its effectiveness. Conventional products often rely on synthetic ingredients for shelf life and sensory appeal, using preservatives, artificial colors, and fragrances that can irritate sensitive skin or cause allergic reactions. In contrast, natural skincare prioritizes biocompatibility \u2014 how well the ingredients work with your skin\u2019s natural biology. By focusing on fewer, more gentle ingredients, these products are less likely to cause irritation and are often more effective at promoting overall skin health. Plus, they typically embrace eco-friendly practices, from sustainable sourcing to thoughtful packaging. Instead of relying on harsh chemicals, non-toxic skincare uses safe, natural ingredients that provide similar benefits without the harmful side effects: \u2022 Sulfate Alternatives: Look for cleansers using coconut-derived surfactants like coco-glucoside or decyl glucoside, which are much gentler on the skin and the environment. \u2022 Paraben-Free Preservatives: Brands often use plant-based preservatives like radish root ferment or rosemary extract to keep products fresh without hormone-disrupting effects. \u2022 Phthalate-Free: For fragrance, choose products that use essential oils instead of synthetic fragrances, which can contain phthalates. \u2022 Mineral Oil Alternatives: Opt for plant oils like jojoba, argan, or rosehip oil, which nourish the skin while allowing it to breathe. For me, it\u00b4s essential finding nontoxic skin care products that can effectively work on my sensitive skin, removing all my makeup and nourish and moisturize, while also aligning with my values \u2014 effective, gentle, and kind to the planet.  Image by Jennifer Chen on Unsplash \u2018Organic\u2019 in skincare means ingredients are grown without harmful pesticides synthetic fertilizers Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) This results in purer, nutrient-rich products that are better for your skin and the environment. Certified organic products, like those marked USDA Organic, ensure strict adherence to these standards, reflecting a brand\u2019s commitment to quality, sustainability, and ethical practices. Natural organic ingredients are also often richer in essential nutrients, antioxidants, and vitamins, as they are grown in healthier, more balanced soil. Certification is crucial in the world of organic skin care. It assures consumers that a product meets rigorous organic standards throughout its production process. Organic certification also often indicates a brand\u2019s broader commitment to ethical practices, including environmental preservation and fair labor standards. For U.S. brands, USDA certified organic is the label to look for.  Image by Bee Naturalles on Unsplash Ethical considerations in skincare go beyond just the ingredients. They encompass the impact on animals, the environment, and broader societal implications. \u2022 Cruelty-Free: Products are not tested on animals, a commitment often certified by the globally recognized Leaping Bunny. \u2022 Vegan: No animal-derived ingredients, with a focus on plant-based alternatives that are gentler and more sustainable. \u2022 Certified B Corp: Brands with B Corp certification demonstrate a commitment to social and environmental responsibility, adding another layer of ethical integrity. Opting for Opting for non-toxic skincare brings a multitude of benefits for both your skin and the environment. Free from toxic chemicals: No parabens, sulfates, or synthetic fragrances, reducing the risk of skin irritations, allergies, and long-term health issues like hormone disruption. Natural ingredients: Plant extracts, essential oils, and botanicals rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to nourish, protect, and rejuvenate skin more effectively. Supports environmental sustainability: Eco-friendly production practices, including organic farming. Cruelty-free testing, ensuring no harm to animals. Biodegradable or recyclable packaging, reducing environmental impact. Choosing non-toxic skincare is not just about avoiding harmful chemicals; it\u2019s also about finding products that truly work for your skin\u2019s unique needs. Dr. Ellen Marmur, a renowned dermatologist and skincare expert, emphasizes, \u201cYour skin is unique, so customize your routine accordingly.\u201d So you also need to find the products and create a routine that supports your skin\u2019s natural balance and health, tailored specifically for you.  Image by Anthony Tran on Unsplash Yes, it can be beneficial, especially for those with sensitive skin or allergies, as it typically contains fewer irritants. The natural ingredients often provide essential nutrients for skin health. Organic skincare, free from harmful chemicals and pesticides, is often gentler and more beneficial for the skin. It also supports sustainable farming practices. Yes, many natural skincare products are effective and use ingredients that have been used in skincare rituals for hundreds of years. Natural beauty at its best. 'Clean beauty' refers to products formulated without harmful chemicals, focusing on safe, non-toxic ingredients for both health and the environment.

We're all trying to navigate a world filled with environmental toxins, from BPA to air pollution, and it feels like our bodies are constantly playing catch-up. Why add more to the mix with makeup and skincare ? Let\u2019s dive into the world of beauty products and really see what we\u2019re putting on our skin. It\u2019s time to make informed choices about the products that touch our skin daily and to find beauty options that are as safe as they are effective. Let\u2019s empower ourselves with knowledge and choose safer options for our skin\u2014the largest organ we have.  Be Aware of Harmful Chemical Ingredients: Avoid cosmetics with formaldehyde, heavy metals, phthalates, and artificial fragrances. These can disrupt hormones and cause serious health issues, including cancer and reproductive harm. Question Misleading Labels: Don't be fooled by claims like \u2018safe for babies\u2019 or \u2018hypoallergenic.\u2019 Investigate the ingredients yourself, as federal labeling laws have loopholes that may not require all chemicals to be listed. Check for Hidden Chemicals: Many products contain substances not immediately apparent due to gaps in labeling requirements. Use ingredient checker resources like the Environmental Working Group\u2019s Skin Deep Database, Think Dirty, CosDNA, SKinCarisma, CodeCheck or DetoxMe to research product safety. Advocate for Stricter Regulations: Support initiatives aimed at tightening industry standards to ensure safer beauty products. Engage with groups like the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics for more information and to get involved. Opt for Non-Toxic Beauty: Choose clean beauty products with safer ingredients by referring to verified non-toxic lists and organic certifications, like Ecocert, Cosmos, USDA Organic and others. Consider using DIY skincare alternatives to further reduce exposure to harmful chemicals.  From your everyday lipstick to your special occasion perfume, harmful chemical ingredients can stealthily sneak into your cosmetic bag. And what\u2019s worse, many of these toxic chemicals are hiding in plain sight, listed on product labels under innocent-sounding names. So, how can you tell which of your beloved beauty products might be harmful to your health? Let\u2019s start by identifying the most common offenders. Formaldehyde, heavy metals, and phthalates, oh my\u2026 These are just a few of the harmful ingredients commonly found in makeup and personal care products. Phthalates, along with parabens, are examples of endocrine disrupting chemicals that can interfere with the hormone system. For instance, formaldehyde-releasing preservatives are often used in cosmetics and are considered toxic. And let\u2019s not forget about heavy metals like lead and mercury that can sometimes be found in your favorite beauty products, posing toxic risks. Which chemicals are the true villains? The ones that you should avoid at all costs? Here\u2019s a rundown of the 12 toxic chemicals you should avoid in skincare products, known as the \u201cDirty Dozen.\u201d These ingredients can have adverse effects on your health and the environment. Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA and BHT) Found in: Moisturizers, makeup, exfoliants, perfume. Health Risks: Anticipated to be a human carcinogen, suspected endocrine disruptors and may cause cancer; associated with skin irritation. Opt for non toxic moisturizers and products with natural preservatives, such as vitamin E (tocopherol), and prioritize products labeled \u201cBHA/BHT-free.\u201d Coal Tar Dyes (p-phenylenediamine and CI numbers) Found in: Hair dyes and colored cosmetics . Health Risks: Derived from petroleum and can be contaminated with heavy metals toxic to the brain. Contains potential carcinogens linked to bladder and breast cancers. Paraphenylenediamine (PPD) is particularly hazardous, leading to skin irritation, allergic reactions, and blood toxicity. Choose plant-based dyes or henna for hair color. For makeup, look for mineral-based pigments and products labeled \u201ccoal tar-free.\u201d DEA-related ingredients Found in: Creamy and foaming products, such as moisturizers and shampoos. Health Risks: Can react to form nitrosamines, which may cause cancer. Seek out products labeled \u201cDEA-free\u201d and opt for natural, sulfate-free shampoos, conditioners, and soaps. Dibutyl Phthalate Found in: Nail polish and hair sprays. Health Risks: Endocrine disruptor and reproductive toxicant, causing dizziness and headaches in nail salon workers. Prolonged exposure may contribute to asthma and respiratory issues. Look for nail polishes labeled \u201cphthalate-free\u201d or choose \u201c5-Free\u201d or \u201c7-Free\u201d formulas. You can also try making your own nail polish. Formaldehyde and its relatives Found in: A wide range of cosmetics Health Risks: Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen and can cause skin allergies, tissue irritation, and have the potential to form carcinogenic compounds. Even at low levels, such as 250 parts per million, formaldehyde can pose health concerns, and these risks can increase with higher temperatures or longer storage times. To avoid formaldehyde-releasing chemicals in personal care products, consumers can check labels for ingredients like Quaternium-15 and DMDM Hydantoin, which release formaldehyde. Check labels for common formaldehyde-releasing preservatives like DMDM Hydantoin and Quaternium-15, and opt for natural alternatives. Parabens (Paraben, methylparaben, butylparaben and propylparaben) Found in: Makeup, body washes, deodorants, shampoos and facial cleansers. Health Risks: Potential endocrine disruptors which may interfere with male and female reproductive functions, promote breast cancer Choose products labeled \u201cparaben-free\u201d and try making your own chemical-free body wash, toothpaste, or moisturizer. Parfum ( Fragrance) Found in: Virtually every type of cosmetic product. Health Risks: Comprised of potentially hundreds of chemicals, including hidden phthalates that disrupt hormones and synthetic musks linked to ecological harm. Despite their pervasive use, the specific chemical components of fragrances often remain undisclosed due to trade secret labeling, making it difficult for consumers to identify potential allergens or toxins. Laboratory studies have shown that these compounds can exacerbate asthma, trigger allergies, and even contribute to long-term health issues like endocrine disruption. Opt for a BHA- and phthalate-free perfume or choose naturally scented products with essential oils. PEG Compounds Found in: Cream-based cosmetics. Health Risks: Can contain ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane, both known carcinogens. Opt for PEG-free products and use simpler natural alternatives like shea butter or aloe vera for skin moisturization. Petrolatum Found in: Moisturizers and hair products, mascara, lipstick Health Risks: Can be contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which may cause cancer. Choose natural alternatives like shea butter, cocoa butter, or coconut oil. You can find or try making your own non toxic lipstick, non toxic mascara, or hair mask. Siloxanes Found in: Cosmetics to soften, smooth, and moisten. Health Risks: Suspected endocrine disruptor and reproductive toxicant (cyclotetrasiloxane). Avoid products with \u201csiloxane\u201d or \u201cmethicone\u201d in their names and use natural oils to achieve a moisturizing effect. Sodium Laureth Sulfate Found in: Foaming cosmetics, such as shampoos and body washes. Health Risks: Skin irritation, eye damage, can be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, which may cause cancer. Opt for nontoxic sulfate-free shampoos, soaps, and detergents. Try making your own chemical-free body wash or soap. Triclosan Found in: Antibacterial cosmetics, such as toothpastes and deodorants. Health Risks: Suspected of causing endocrine disruption, allergies and contributing to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Use natural antibacterial alternatives like tea tree oil and choose triclosan-free toothpaste and deodorants. Further on our list of offenders are Heavy Metals (like arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and nickel) Found in: Eye makeup, lipsticks, and skin-lightening products. Health Risks: Can cause neurotoxicity, developmental issues, reproductive toxicity, and organ damage. These toxic ingredients can often contaminate makeup products, leading to significant health issues including skin allergies and cellular damage Choose clean beauty brands that guarantee heavy metal-free products and prioritize those with third-party certifications.  Unfortunately, these toxic ingredients aren\u2019t just harmful in the short term. Long-term exposure to these chemicals can lead to a host of health issues, impacting not only individual health but also public health, including: Skin conditions Hormonal imbalances Neurological issues Increased risk of cancer These are just a few examples of the potential health problems that could arise from using these products over time. And it\u2019s not just adults who are at risk. Research has highlighted that even children in the United States are regularly exposed to toxic chemicals in personal care products, which may contribute to learning and developmental disorders, obesity, and asthma. But what about those products that claim to be \u2018safe for babies\u2019 or \u2018hypoallergenic\u2019? Unfortunately, these labels can be misleading. Certain cosmetic chemicals, such as parabens and phthalates, can affect prenatal and postnatal development and have been linked to various endocrine diseases and types of cancer. To truly prioritize your child's safety, consider switching to safer alternatives like organic baby care products that are free from harmful chemicals. So, it seems that no one is immune to the potential dangers of harmful cosmetic chemicals and the risks associated with chemical exposures, even when using cosmetics and personal care products from reputable cosmetic companies. But don\u2019t despair! There are ways to decode those confusing ingredient lists. Here are some tips to help you: Use tools like the Environmental Working Group\u2019s (EWG) Skin Deep database, Think Dirty, CosDNA, SkinCarisma, CodeCheck, and DetoxMe to check the safety rankings of ingredients in beauty or personal care products. Be aware that cosmetic labels may use misleading names or highlight minor \u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018organic\u2019 ingredients while neglecting to clearly present other components. Just because a product is labeled as \u2018non-toxic\u2019 or \u2018naturally derived\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s safe. Some toxic chemicals in makeup, like certain phthalates, may not be individually disclosed on labels as they are components of fragrances, thus exempt from federal labeling requirements.  By now, you might be feeling a bit overwhelmed by all this information. But remember, knowledge is power. And scientific research is our greatest ally in the fight against harmful cosmetic chemicals. Studies conducted by organizations such as the Environmental Working Group (EWG) have documented the presence of potentially hazardous chemicals in a variety of cosmetic products. And these studies have shown a link between certain cosmetic ingredients and adverse health outcomes like cancer and reproductive problems. When we delve deeper into these studies, we find even more alarming findings. For instance, over 88 chemicals found in more than 73,000 cosmetic products are linked to serious health issues such as cancer, birth defects, or reproductive harm. And it\u2019s not just the obvious offenders like formaldehyde and mercury that are causing problems. Dibutyl phthalate and diethylhexyl phthalate, common ingredients in cosmetics, can cause developmental toxicities and are linked to reproductive system harm and potential carcinogenic effects. There's an urgent need for regulation.  But while we wait for regulations to catch up, what can we do to protect ourselves? The answer lies in embracing non-toxic beauty. By opting for cosmetics with fewer ingredients, reading ingredient lists carefully, and being skeptical of labels like \u2018hypoallergenic\u2019, \u2018non-toxic\u2019, and \u2018natural\u2019, we can reduce the chance of being exposed to potential toxins. Knowledge is your best ally. Understanding the ingredients on labels helps us sidestep potentially harmful chemicals. Certifications like \u2018USDA Organic,\u2019 \u2018Non-GMO Project Verified,\u2019 or the \u2018Leaping Bunny\u2019 serve as safety signals, helping us spot non-toxic cosmetics and avoid those with questionable ingredients. But picking safer products doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing quality or convenience. With resources like databases and guides from trusted organizations, finding clean beauty products is easier than ever. Or, you can try your hand at DIY cosmetics, using natural ingredients to have more control over what touches your skin. By consciously choosing transparent, ingredient-friendly products or even making your own, we can shift the demand toward safer beauty options while still looking and feeling our best.  If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, why not try making your own cosmetics? This can be a fun and rewarding way to ensure that the products you use are safe. Common kitchen ingredients like cocoa powder, arrowroot, and natural oils offer a safer alternative to store-bought cosmetics that may contain harmful chemicals. And the possibilities are endless. You can make everything from shampoo and homemade foundation to blush or even mascara, using safe ingredients like arrowroot powder, clay powders, mica powders, and activated charcoal. Creating your own makeup also gives you the freedom to customize products to match your skin tone and meet your coverage preferences. For instance, homemade mascara can be created with a simple mixture of Aloe Vera Gel, Vitamin E oil, and activated charcoal, offering a natural and safer alternative to conventional mascaras.So, why not give DIY beauty a try? The path to a healthier beauty routine is paved with knowledge and action. We've uncovered the concerning truth about toxic chemicals in beauty products and their potential health risks.

We may earn a commission on purchases, at no additional cost to you. Learn more \u2192 If you've ever used shampoo, moisturizer, or makeup, chances are you've encountered parabens. These chemicals may be hiding in plain sight in your daily routine, as up to\u00a085% of cosmetic products contain them. Parabens are preservatives designed to keep your products free from bacteria. Why parabens are harmful, has been up for debate for decades, as their safety is controversial. It made me wonder: Are these everyday chemicals truly safe, or have we been unknowingly exposing ourselves to potential health risks? Below, I\u2019ll share my journey of discovering the facts, separating hype from reality, and finally deciding where I stand on parabens. Along the way, you\u2019ll find the latest research, expert insights, and practical tips to help you make informed decisions about the products you use every day.  Parabens have been around since the 1920s, originally synthesized to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth in cosmetics, foods, and even pharmaceuticals. From your favorite moisturizer to baked goods, parabens are everywhere! You can typically spot them under names like methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, and ethylparaben, or sometimes just \u201cparahydroxybenzoate.\u201d They\u2019re effective and inexpensive, which makes them an easy go-to for manufacturers looking to extend shelf life. For most of my life, I never gave preservatives in products a second thought. Then \u201cclean beauty\u201d became a buzzword, and I started seeing \u201cparaben-free\u201d everywhere. I wondered if it was just a marketing gimmick or if there was a real reason for concern. Parabens work as antimicrobial agents - blocking bacteria from breaking down amino acids (the building blocks of DNA), preventing bacterial growth and keeping your products safe. They're colorless, and odorless and dissolve seamlessly into formulations, making them ideal for preserving the fragrance and appearance of products.  While parabens have been used for decades and deemed safe by many regulatory agencies, scientific understanding of their potential risks continues to evolve. Parabens first became a hot topic when Dr. Philippa Darbre published a study in 2004 finding traces of parabens in breast cancer tissue, raising initial concerns. Dr. Philippa Darbre's research hit the internet in 2004, when they found traces of parabens in human breast cancer tissues, raising alarms about their potential role in cancer. However, this study was criticized for having a small sample size and lacking control tissues. Even Dr Darbre clarified, \" I have never said that parabens are the sole cause of breast cancer... There are a lot of different factors at play, and they go way beyond parabens\". Although this small study did not prove parabens cause cancer, it was enough to get many consumers and researchers asking questions. A more recent 2024 study examined how EDCs like parabens may alter gene expression epigenetically\u2014potentially raising the risk of breast cancer over time. This research helps explain the potential biological pathways through which long-term paraben exposure might affect health outcomes. While science is still unfolding, these insights push the discussion beyond \u201cdo parabens cause cancer?\u201d toward understanding the subtle ways low-dose exposure could affect our health, especially when combined with other chemicals. Put simply, there is still no definitive consensus on whether parabens are outright dangerous. Yet, each new study hints that there may be more going on beneath the surface than we once believed. While the studies do not prove causation, they raised enough red flags to make people reconsider their exposure to parabens - it certainly has made me think twice about the products I use that contain parabens. Another concern is that parabens are classified as endocrine disruptors (EDCs). They can mimic estrogen, a hormone critical to reproductive health. Parabens are able to bind to estrogen receptors in the body, causing disruption to natural hormone processes. Although parabens\u2019 estrogenic effect is weaker than the body\u2019s natural hormones, multiple exposures from skincare, makeup, and even certain processed foods can create a \u201ccocktail effect.\u201d This means small doses of parabens from multiple sources may accumulate and amplify potential harm over time\u2014whether that\u2019s hormone imbalance, fertility issues, or even an elevated breast cancer risk. For me, this was the tipping point. Realizing that my everyday cleanser, moisturizer, body lotion, and foundation all might contain parabens made me take a closer look at ingredient labels. In rare cases, some people can develop contact dermatitis from parabens. If you have sensitive skin, you might find that reducing or eliminating parabens alleviates redness, itchiness, or breakouts. That\u2019s what initially happened to a friend of mine\u2014her chronic irritation vanished once she switched to paraben-free formulas.  Most regulatory bodies\u2014including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)\u2014view parabens as safe in low concentrations (typically up to 0.4% in a single product or 0.8% when multiple parabens are combined). In practice, cosmetics usually contain about 0.1\u20130.3% paraben concentrations, which is well under these limits. However, the cumulative effect of multiple paraben-containing products everyday is where the real concerns lies. Although these concentrations are considered safe on an individual product level, regulators increasingly recognize that we might be exposed to parabens from many products every day. That\u2019s why the European Union restricts or bans certain parabens (like isopropylparaben) a and requires transparent labeling. Some regulators and scientists argue more research is needed, especially regarding long-term, repeated exposure. As dermatologist Dr. Shari Linnet from Weill Cornell Medicine explains, \"Parabens are considered safe in small in low concentrations, as they are used in very small amounts in cosmetics and skincare products. Though some people may choose to avoid them due to concerns about potential hormonal effects\" Even though certain parabens are banned in the EU, and stricter labelling regulations exist, the debate about long-term exposure continues. It's not just about human health when it comes to parabens, as they come with their fair share of environmental concerns as they are washed down our drains they enter and contaminate the water systems, and have even been found in aquatic organisms. For example, butylparaben has been shown to harm marine life, including coral reefs, contributing to ecological damage. While research on the full environmental impact of parabens is ongoing, its clear they have a role in pollution. Fortunately, many brands are now adopting eco-friendly alternatives to minimise harm to mitigate potential environmental and health risks. Myth 1: \"Natural products are always paraben-free\" Whilst we would all like to believe this is true, sadly, this is a myth. Even products labeled as 'natural' or 'organic' may contain synthetic preservatives like parabens, often hidden under less recognizable names Myth 2: \"Small amounts of parabens are harmless\" While individual products might contain trace amounts of parabens, the cumulative exposure from using multiple products daily, think of it as a slow build-up over time. Major four parabens can hide under names like: Methylparaben (MP) Ethyl paraben (EP) Propyl paraben (PP) Butyl paraben (BP) They might also appear as 'parahydroxylbenzoate' on labels. And don't forget to check your other beauty products, you may be surprised to find parabens in your toothpaste and deodorants, foods and even in our prescriptions!  If you're looking to switch to parabens-free products, here are some options to consider: Look for natural skincare brands that use safer alternatives like phenoxyethanol, sodium benzoate, or potassium sorbate, these preservatives, are less likely to disrupt your hormones.However, they are not entirely without risks and may require careful formulation to balance safety and efficacy. Natural/Organic Alternatives: Plant-based preservatives like essential oils or vitamin E can work well, though they're generally safer, they're less effective than in water-based products, have shorter shelf lives and limited antimicrobial efficacy. Innovative Packaging: Airtight containers reduce the need for preservatives by minimizing exposure to air and bacteria. Switching to paraben-free products doesn't have to be overwhelming, here's how to get started on your journey to non-toxic living and switching to paraben-free: Start small: Replace frequently used items like lotion, shampoo or toothpaste first. When I started, I first replaced my skincare, and slowly phased out unnecessary chemicals like fragrance, phthlates etc. Brands like Herbivore Botanicals*, Earth Mama Organics*, Tata Harper* offer affordable paraben-free products, perfect for easy swaps! Read labels and Clean Beauty Certifications: Look for 'paraben-free' certifications or trusted labels like USDA Organic or EWG Verified Use Tools: Apps now exist so that you can decode cosmetic ingredient lists, some good ones include: Yuka (my personal favourite) Good On You ThinkDirty Environmental Working Group Skin Deep Patch Test: Always test new products on a small patch of skin, before full use, especially if they contain natural ingredients like essential oils. Choose safer alternatives for easy swaps like soap, lip balm and any other toxic products you may have in your cupboards! Many people who have made the switch to paraben-free products report seeing tangible improvements in their skin and overall well-being. For instance, Kayleigh Dray noticed that after eliminating parabens from her routine, her complexion looked clearer and healthier. She also became more conscious of every ingredient on her labels, which led to fewer impulse buys and no more half-finished cosmetics cluttering her bathroom. On the other hand, industry experts acknowledge the complexity of the debate. Tiffany Masterson, founder of Drunk Elephant, has stated \"Parabens are actually a good ingredient. But because consumers don't want them, we avoid using them\" This highlights how consumer demand and personal values can be just as influential as scientific data when it comes to selecting skincare ingredients. Taken together, these perspectives showcase the nuanced decision-making behind going paraben-free. While scientific research continues to evolve, personal experiences and brand philosophies also play a major role in determining whether parabens fit into our daily routines.

Parabens are widely used preservatives that effectively prevent bacterial growth They have potential endocrine-disrupting effects and may harm marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs. Identifying parabens (methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben) on labels helps you make informed choices. Regulatory agencies consider parabens safe at low concentrations, but cumulative exposure raises concerns. Safer alternatives include phenoxyethanol, sodium benzoate, or potassium sorbate. Airtight packaging can further reduce chemical exposure. Transitioning to paraben-free products is a process, start small by replacing high-exposure items in your skincare and makeup essentials, and research alternatives Ultimately, why parabens are harmful depends on how you weigh the evidence, the potential risks, and your personal comfort level. My own experience taught me that questioning what goes on (and in) our bodies is a lifelong process.  The good news? Knowledge empowers us to be conscious consumers\u2014and that\u2019s a win, parabens or not. Are parabens really harmful? Parabens are considered safe at low concentrations by regulatory bodies like the FDA and EMA, but their potential risks have sparked debate. They are classified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) because they can mimic estrogen and disrupt hormonal processes, potentially contributing to health issues such as early puberty or fertility problems with long-term exposure. However, evidence linking parabens to severe health risks like cancer remains inconclusive, with studies like the 2004 Darbre study criticized for methodological limitations Why is paraben banned in Europe? Certain parabens, such as isopropylparaben and isobutylparaben, are banned in Europe due to concerns about their potential endocrine-disrupting effects and insufficient data to confirm their safety. The EU limits the concentration of other parabens in cosmetics to 0.4% individually or 0.8% when combined, citing a precautionary approach to protect consumers from potential long-term risks. Why do dermatologists recommend products with parabens? Dermatologists often recommend products with parabens because they are effective preservatives that prevent bacterial and fungal contamination, ensuring product safety and longevity. Parabens are also considered \"weak allergens\" compared to alternative preservatives like methylisothiazolinone, which are more likely to cause skin irritation or allergic reactions.\u00a0Despite their controversial reputation, dermatologists emphasize that parabens are safe when used in low concentrations as regulated by authorities Disclaimer: This article is intended for informational purposes only and not as a substitute for professional medical advice.

The average person uses around 12 personal care products daily, exposing themselves to about 168 different chemicals (EWG). Understanding the importance of non-toxic products is essential in this context, as they play a significant role in a non-toxic lifestyle and underscore the importance of being a mindful consumer. From the living room to the kitchen, the laundry room to the bathrooms and bedrooms, we interact with countless items daily. Now, imagine walking into a supermarket\u2014how many choices do we make unconsciously, without knowing what\u2019s really in the products we buy? Think about how many of these things might be hiding chemicals you can\u2019t even pronounce. As a mother and founder of a company dedicated to sustainable practices, I\u2019ve been on this journey myself. I discovered that many everyday products\u2014cleaning supplies, skincare items, even our beloved candles\u2014were filled with harmful toxins. Embracing a non toxic lifestyle has been a crucial part of my journey, highlighting the importance of reducing toxin exposure from various sources for both health and environmental benefits. In this article, we\u2019ll explore what non-toxic products are, the difference between toxic and non-toxic items, and outline five reasons to switch to non-toxic products. So, let\u2019s embark on this journey and see how simple changes can lead to a healthier, happier home.  In the past century alone, we've seen an unprecedented rise in the use of synthetic chemicals and materials. Industries and big companies have prioritized cheaper production and mass manufacturing, often at the expense of our health and the environment. From plastics to pesticides, we are now exposed to a myriad of toxic substances daily\u2014substances that didn't even exist a hundred years ago. Non-toxic products, also known as toxic-free, offer a way to reclaim a safer, healthier lifestyle. These products are designed to be safe for humans, animals, and the environment. They avoid harmful substances that can cause health issues, such as reproductive harm or developmental toxicity. By choosing non-toxic products, we reduce our exposure to dangerous chemicals that have become all too common in modern life.  For instance, traditional personal care items often contain parabens and phthalates\u2014chemicals linked to hormone disruption and cancer. Cleaning supplies can include ammonia and bleach, which are harmful to our respiratory system. Even our beloved candles and air fresheners might harbor toxic compounds like formaldehyde and phthalates, which are linked to reproductive issues and birth defects. Non-toxic building materials, like VOC-free paints and sustainably sourced wood, help create a healthier indoor environment by not releasing pollutants. Even in the realm of energy, non-toxic fuels like hydrogen produce only water vapor when burned, making them a cleaner option for the planet. Embracing non-toxic products means opting for items that are thoroughly tested and certified to be free from harmful chemicals. They align with standards that prioritize safety over cost-cutting, ensuring they don't release pollutants or cause health risks. By choosing non-toxic products, you minimize your exposure to harmful chemicals found in many conventional items. This can significantly reduce the risk of health issues, from allergies and asthma to more serious conditions like cancer and heart disease. As consumers, by supporting small brands that care, we also support a more balanced way of life. By making healthier choices, we also promote a more sustainable and ethical approach to manufacturing and consumption.  Image by Bee Naturalles No Harmful Chemicals: Non-toxic products are free from parabens, phthalates, and other nasties. These chemicals can mess with your hormones and cause health issues. For more info, check out the EWG guide. Biodegradable Ingredients: They break down easily and don\u2019t harm the environment. It\u2019s good for you and Mother Earth. Baking soda is a prime example of a biodegradable ingredient used in non-toxic cleaning products for its natural cleaning properties. Hypoallergenic: They\u2019re gentle on your skin and reduce the risk of allergies. When shopping for non-toxic products, look for reliable certifications. These labels mean the product meets safety and environmental standards: Ecocert: A global certification for organic and natural products. Green Seal: Ensures the product meets strict health and environmental standards. USDA Organic: For products that meet rigorous organic farming practices, avoiding synthetic fertilizers and GMOs. EPA Safer Choice: Products that contain safer chemicals, are beneficial for human health and the environment. GREENGUARD: For low-emission products like furniture and building materials, ensuring minimal chemical emissions. EWG Verified: For personal care products free from the Environmental Working Group's chemicals of concern. NSF/ANSI 305: For personal care products with organic ingredients, ensuring specific organic content and processing methods. OEKO-TEX Standard 100: For textiles tested for harmful substances, meeting strict chemical limits. Toxic Chemicals in Personal Care Products: Many personal care products contain toxic chemicals that can be absorbed through the skin, potentially causing health problems. For example, some shampoos contain formaldehyde-releasing agents, which have been linked to cancer and reproductive issues. Toxic Chemicals in Cleaning Products: Cleaning products can also contain toxic chemicals that can harm human health. For instance, some all-purpose cleaners contain phthalates, which have been linked to birth defects and reproductive issues. Toxic Chemicals in Food Packaging: Food packaging can also contain toxic chemicals that can leach into food. For example, some food packaging contains BPA, a chemical linked to cancer and reproductive issues. Toxic Chemicals in Furniture and Carpets: Furniture and carpets can also contain toxic chemicals that can harm human health. For instance, some furniture and carpets contain flame retardants, which have been linked to cancer and reproductive issues. Toxic Chemicals in Air Fresheners and Candles: Air fresheners and candles can also contain toxic chemicals that can harm human health. For example, some air fresheners contain phthalates, which have been linked to birth defects and reproductive issues. Just because a product is labeled \"natural\" doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s non-toxic. Some \"natural\" products may still contain harmful ingredients. For example, essential oils in skincare products can cause allergic reactions, and \"natural\" cleaners might include irritating substances. It\u2019s crucial to look beyond marketing terms and examine what\u2019s inside these products. Reading ingredient lists carefully is essential. Don\u2019t rely solely on terms like \u201cnatural\u201d to gauge a product\u2019s safety. Ingredients matter, and some harmful substances, including toxic chemicals and E numbers representing ingredients or additives, might be hidden under generic labels like \u201cfragrance\u201d or \u201cperfume,\u201d which can contain a mix of undisclosed chemicals. To reduce toxins in the food you consume, avoiding these toxic chemicals by scrutinizing ingredient lists is crucial. To identify truly non-toxic products, look for certifications and focus on transparency from brands. Trustworthy brands will: List All Ingredients: Avoid products that hide behind vague terms. Provide Sourcing Information: Transparent brands disclose where and how their ingredients are sourced. Earn Certifications: Certifications from reputable organizations indicate that products have been independently verified for safety. Utilizing resources like the Skin Deep Database is beneficial for checking product safety ratings and ensuring that the products are genuinely non-toxic. This database rates personal care products based on their toxicity levels, helping you make informed decisions  Switching to non-toxic products offers a range of benefits, from reduced health risks to environmental impacts. The average person is exposed to millions of toxins daily, making the switch to non-toxic products beneficial for health, the planet, and animals. Here are five reasons why you should make the switch: Many traditional cleaning products and personal care items contain harsh chemicals that can be harmful to your health. Non-toxic products are made with natural ingredients that are gentler on your skin and body, reducing your risk of developing health problems like allergies, hormone imbalances, and even certain types of cancer. These products also contain chemicals that persist in the environment, causing long-term damage. Drinking Water: Chemicals from household products can find their way into drinking water sources. Even treated water can retain traces of these substances. Marine Life: Chemicals from household products can cause deformities in fish and other marine life. Nutrient pollution can also lead to dead zones in bodies of water. Landfills: Chemicals from household products contribute to pollution and global warming when they end up in landfills. Switch to non-toxic cleaning products and toxin free dish soap. Choosing products made from natural ingredients ensures a healthier home and a cleaner planet.  Many conventional products release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to indoor air pollution. According to the EPA, the typical American home has chemical contamination levels 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor air. Non-toxic alternatives, such as VOC-free paints and natural cleaning supplies, help improve indoor air quality, making your home a healthier place to live. Household Cleaning Products: Spraying conventional cleaners releases toxic fumes into the air, which settle on surfaces and carpets. Ironically, the chemicals meant to clean are contaminating our indoor environment. Air Fresheners: Products like sprays, plug-ins, and candles often contain artificial fragrances that can be harmful when inhaled. Off-Gassing: Furniture, mattresses, carpets, and paints can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air over time, adding to indoor pollution. To start improving your indoor air quality, stop using air fresheners, review your cleaning products, and consider switching to natural options as your current products run out. When it\u2019s time to buy new furniture or paint, choose items without harmful chemicals. For tips on improving indoor air quality, visit the EPA\u2019s guide.  Non-toxic personal care products avoid harmful chemicals like parabens and phthalates, which can irritate the skin and disrupt hormones. Healthier skin is just one switch away. Opting for non-toxic skincare means gentler, safer products that promote healthier skin. Explore safe skincare options through the Skin Deep Database. Here are some common offenders: Shampoo: Can contain 1,4-Dioxane, a probable human carcinogen, and DMDM hydantoin, linked to hair loss and scalp burns. Deodorant: Often made with hormone-disrupting chemicals like parabens and phthalates. Lipstick: Bright colors can come from toxic heavy metals like lead and chromium. Nail Polish: Many brands use harmful chemicals like formaldehyde and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Start by replacing the beauty products you use most frequently and those with the highest toxicity with nontoxic shampoo, clean deodorant, non-toxic lipsticks, clean makeup and toxin-free nail polishes. Over time, find non-toxic replacements for all your favorite products.  Non-toxic products are often biodegradable and made from renewable resources. They break down easily and don\u2019t harm the environment, making them a better choice for you and Mother Earth. Incorporating locally grown food into your diet is another way to support a non-toxic, environmentally friendly lifestyle. Sourcing food that's grown in natural environments and within the appropriate season reduces the toxins in the food we consume, though it presents challenges in accessibility and practicality for many.  Many non-toxic products come from brands prioritize ethical manufacturing practices, including fair labor and sustainable sourcing. By choosing these sustainable and organic products, you support companies committed to making a positive impact on the world. Look for products with certifications like Ecocert, GOTS, Fair Trade Certified, and many others to ensure you\u2019re supporting ethical brands. Assess Your Current Products: Take an inventory of all cleaning, personal care, and food products you use regularly. Note which ones contain harmful chemicals. Educate Yourself: Learn about common toxic chemicals found in household products and their health effects. Resources like the Environmental Working Group (EWG) can be helpful. Start with Essentials: Replace the most frequently used and toxic items first. This might include cleaning products, shampoo bars, deodorant, and cookware. Read Labels: Become diligent about reading ingredient labels. Look for products with fewer and more natural ingredients. Avoid products with long lists of unpronounceable chemicals. Look for Certifications: Choose products that are certified non-toxic by reputable organizations. Labels like USDA Organic, Green Seal, and EWG Verified can guide you. Gradually Replace: As you run out of old products, replace them with non-toxic alternatives. This approach is less overwhelming and more budget-friendly. DIY Options: Consider making your own cleaning and personal care products using simple, natural ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, and essential oils. Support Ethical Brands: Purchase from companies that prioritize sustainability and transparency. Your consumer choices can drive demand for safer products. Mind Your Diet: Buy organic produce and meats to reduce exposure to pesticides and hormones. Avoid processed foods with artificial additives. Create a Non-Toxic Home: Use non-toxic materials for home renovations and new furniture. Choose zero-VOC paints and natural fiber carpets. Spread the Word: Share your knowledge and experiences with friends and family. Encouraging others to switch to non-toxic products amplifies the positive impact. By following these steps, you can significantly reduce your exposure to harmful chemicals and contribute to a healthier environment for yourself and your loved ones.

I know that feeling all too well. After struggling with chronic migraines for years, I discovered that small, consistent holistic habits were the key to reclaiming my health and vitality. Today, I'm sharing the science-backed practices that not only helped me become migraine-free but continue to support my overall wellbeing. Life today moves at lightning speed, making it difficult to slow down. Between technological advances and the self-improvement culture, we rarely take time for ourselves to incorporate holistic habits to take care of ourselves. The reality is stark - over 280 million people struggle with depression globally, while chronic illnesses continue rising due to poor diet, physical inactivity, and chronic stress. But there's hope in taking a holistic approach to health. Luckily for you, you have information right at your fingertips ! In this guide, I\u2019ll share 11 proven, science-backed habits to help you take control of your well-being, starting today.  The word \"holistic\" originates from the Greek word\u00a0holos, meaning \"whole\" or \"entire.\" \" It is commonly used in contexts where an integrated or comprehensive perspective is essential. Holistic approaches aim to address multiple aspects of a system, recognizing that these aspects are interdependent and cannot be fully understood in isolation. So holistic health is a practice that recognizes the connection between the mind, body, and spirit. Instead of focusing on symptoms, it looks at your well-being, aiming to nourish every aspect of your life! Holistic health has deep roots in ancient medical systems. Two of the most influential traditions that shaped holistic health are Ayurveda from India and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) from East Asia. These systems have been practiced for thousands of years and continue to influence modern approaches to well-being. Interconnectedness: Recognizing that all parts of a system are connected and influence one another. Balance: Striving for harmony among various components. Integration: Combining multiple perspectives or methods to address issues comprehensively. Personalization: Adapting approaches to individual needs or contexts. Holistic habits are simple, everyday practices that bring balance and ease to your day. By making intentional choices about your habits, you prioritize how you want to feel, taking charge of your well-being. In today's fast-paced world, these are essential - helping you to manage stress, improve health, and foster a deeper connection with yourself and the world around you. Instead of just treating symptoms, holistic habits build a foundation for lasting wellbeing by: Stress and anxiety reduction: Mindfulness and meditation programs can reduce your stress levels by 20-30%, whilst improving anxiety and depression symptoms! Boosting immunity: Studies show that long-term meditation and physical exercise boost immune function and enhance brain activity related to attention Mental Clarity: Regular habits of expressing gratitude and mindfulness can significantly lower anxiety and boost cognitive function Supporting natural healing processes Creating sustainable energy and vitality There benefits to holistic living are endless. However, it's not about making drastic changes all at once; but about taking small, sustainable steps in a way that feels natural to you.  Let's explore each habit in detail, with clear steps to implement them in your daily life. Mindfulness is a powerful, science-backed practice that improves emotional regulation, focus, and stress levels. Who wouldn't want that? What's great is that meditation can be as short or as long as you'd like, and there are plenty of apps to help guide you through it.  Dr. Joe Dispenza explains that practicing mindfulness and meditation can rewire your brain, making it more resilient: \" With a single intervention, we've seen profound changes and improvements for multiple health conditions. And there are no 'side effects', unless you count a newfound love for life - and for yourself\" A 2011 study in Neuroimage even showed that mindfulness strengthens connections in the brain related to attention and sensory processing! Morning meditation: Start your day with meditation. Apps like Calm and Headspace, or free YouTube guided sessions (my favourite!) are great options! With so many choices, you can pick the voice and vibe that feels right! Layer mindfulness into your day: You don't always need dedicated meditation. I often practice mindfulness by paying attention to the details of everyday tasks like walking, cooking, or washing dishes. Fully immerse your senses! Listen to mindfulness playlists: Try listening to music at 432 Hz on YouTube and Spotify to help ground yourself! Journalling: My favorite practice! Journalling each morning and evening clears my head and helps me process my thoughts. The Day One app is great for digital journalling if that's your preference! Further experts and sources:Dr. Kelly McGonigal, Book: The Upside of Stress*  Whole, nutrient-dense foods are the foundation of good health. They support cellular repair and prevent deficiencies. Studies from the world's Blue Zone\u2014regions with the healthiest, longest-living populations\u2014show that plant-based diets with small amounts of animal products are key to longevity and low chronic disease rates. These diets emphasize whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, and healthy fats like olive oil. (I recommend the Netflix documentary). The secret? Seeing food as nourishment and fuel, not restriction. Shift your mindset and prioritize vibrant, nutrient-rich whole foods to support muscle and cellular repair. Experts: Dr. Mark Hyman \u201cFood is not just calories, it\u2019s information\u2014it talks to your DNA and tells it what to do.\u201d Book: Food: What the Heck Should I Eat?Paul Check, a Holistic Health Practitioner, Book: How to Eat, Move and Be Healthy!\u00a0 Intermittent Fasting (IF): A science-backed way to sync your eating with your body's natural rhythm, promoting energy and metabolism, while improving insulin sensitivity and reducing inflammation. For women, circadian fasting (eating during daylight hours) allows for alignment with your hormonal cycles, optimizing energy levels. Superfoods for Longevity: Foods like blueberries, broccoli or turmeric, amongst many others, are rich in antioxidants and bioactive compounds that support immune health, reduce inflammation, and promote overall well-being.  Hydration Tips: Proper hydration is essential for maintaining overall health. Opt for filtered water as your primary source of hydration and include water-rich foods like cucumber in your diet.  Time-Restricted Eating: Begin with a 12:12 fasting window, gradually moving to 16:8 for enhanced metabolism Batch cook nutrient-dense meals to avoid making unhealthy food choices: Prepare meals in advance using whole foods like grains, legumes, vegetables, and healthy fats. Shop at farmers\u2019 markets for seasonal organic produce to support your community, and ensure your food is fresh and full of nutrients Diversify your microbiome: Your gut thrives on variety; challenge yourself to try one new recipe or ingredient each week, and a diverse diet rich in fiber from fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains to promote gut health. Movement is\u00a0a cornerstone of\u00a0physical and\u00a0mental well-being. If\u00a0I had to choose just one habit to prioritize, it\u00a0would be this\u00a0one.\u00a0 Moving your body daily not only reduces stress and anxiety, but it also makes you stronger and boosts your cardiovascular health - and you feel great afterward! Studies show that exercising at least 500 minutes (~ 8 hours) per week lowers your risk of cardiovascular events by 17% and reduces anxiety-related events by 22%. One study found that exercise can be as effective as therapy or antidepressants for reducing depression! Daily Movement for Mental Health  Strength Training for Longevity: Building muscle is crucial for aging well, preventing disability, and reducing all-cause mortality. Research shows that greater muscle strength correlates with a all-cause mortality deriction by 15%, even among older adults.  Exercise Snacks: Short bursts of movement throughout the day can be just as impactful as longer workouts. Quick 10-minute walks: Start your day with a walk around the block or park - I personally love doing this at lunchtime to clear my mind, and stretch my legs! Incorporate Exercise snacks: Try incorporating 10 bodyweight squats every hour. This simple habit can improve your blood sugar regulation more than a 30-minute walk! Strength Training Routine: Begin with simple exercises like squats, lunges, or resistance band workouts. Aim for two sessions per week focused on building muscle strength. PRO Tip: Consider trying heat therapy (sauna) or cold plunges to amplify the benefits of your workouts and improve muscle recovery Experts and further reading:Dr. Kelly McGonigal: \u201cMovement is one of the most powerful ways to build emotional strength.\u201d Book: The Joy of Movement  Gratitude and self-compassion  are transformative practices that can profoundly improve your mindset,  reducing burnout and increasing resilience. These habits not only enhance mood and happiness but also strengthen relationships and improve your ability to navigate life's challenges. Research supports the profound impact of these practices: In\u00a0The Little Book of Gratitude, Robert Emmons notes that practicing gratitude can lower cortisol levels\u2014the body's primary stress hormone\u2014by approximately 23%, which in turn positively affects metabolism, immune function, and overall stress regulation. Self-compassion has been shown to reduce self-criticism, improve emotional resilience, and promote healthier coping mechanisms during times of stress or adversity Gratitude journaling: Write down what you're grateful for daily, or use apps like Grateful, which lets you do this on your phone Bedtime reflections: Before sleep, reflect on the highlights of your day e.g. a delicious meal, or a smile from a stranger - no matter how small Create self-care rituals: Take time to nurture yourself with activities like reading, enjoying a bath, or using a face mask. Prioritize kindness to yourself! Self-Compassion Journal: When facing challenges, write about them as if you were comforting a close friend. This exercise helps reframe negative self-talk into supportive inner dialogue. Affirmations: Use  positive affirmations like \"All is well\" or \"I am loved\" to counteract self-critical thoughts. Experts and further Reading:Dr. Tara Swart \u201cGratitude rewires your brain to seek positivity, which reinforces emotional resilience.\u201d Book: The Source \u00a0   Research shows that even short periods outdoors can significantly reduce stress,  lower anxiety, improve mood, and\u00a0boost cognitive function. A study published in\u00a0Nature\u00a0revealed that just\u00a020 minutes in\u00a0a natural environment can lower cortisol levels\u2014the body's primary stress hormone\u2014making it\u00a0a simple yet\u00a0powerful way\u00a0to combat stress and enhance mental clarity. Ground yourself: Walking barefoot on the earth can reduce stress, and improve your sleep and mood significantly! Plan weekend hikes or outdoor workouts: Swap the treadmill for a trail. Outdoor exercise not only boosts your fitness but also sharpens your mind, leaving you feeling refreshed. Use apps like\u00a0AllTrails\u00a0to discover nearby hiking trails or outdoor fitness spots.  Bring the nature inside: As a plant mum myself, I am an advocate for surrounding yourself with plants and fresh flowers to boost your creativity and air quality! Consider low-maintenance plants like snake plants or pothos if you're new to plant care. Experts and further Reading: Dr. Dean Ornish : \u201cA combination of healthy habits, not pills, is the most powerful tool for disease reversal.\u201d Book: Undo It! (co-authored with Anne Ornish)  The people in your life that make you laugh, or share quiet moments with, these connections aren't just nice to have, they are essential. Harvard's 80-year-old study shared in the 'The Good Life' revealed that strong relationships not only boost happiness but are also pivotal to your health and longevity. People with meaningful connections experience less stress, and mental health issues and also live longer. Host intentional gatherings: Invite a few friends over for a dinner, or a casual hangout. The moments create deeper, more meaningful connections! Join a group or community: Whether it's volunteering, a book club, or a hiking group, putting yourself out there helps you meet like-minded people Practice active listening: Next time you're with someone, fully focus on what others are saying without planning your response. This strengthens your relationships and shows genuine care  Too much screen time or cluttered spaces can leave you feeling drained and overwhelmed. Research shows that constant exposure to digital technologies can make mpair concentration, stifle creativity, and even foster feelings of isolation. In fact, 48% of people in the US reported feeling addicted to their devices. \u00a0A digital detox\u2014a deliberate break from technology\u2014can help reduce dependency, improve sleep, and lower stress levels, creating more balance in your life. Schedule detox days: Set aside a day or weekend to unplug, take a break from social media, and indulge in activities you often feel 'too busy' for Create screen-free zones: Keep devices out of your bedroom, dining room, and bathroom to limit over-exposure Time block your digital life: Allocate specific times for checking your emails or scrolling to social media - and stick to them!

Feeling sluggish and low on energy is a common experience in today\u2019s fast-paced world, often due to stress, overindulgence, and exposure to toxins in food, water, and the environment. Your liver, the body\u2019s natural detoxifier, plays a crucial role in processing these toxins. However, it can sometimes feel overworked. Supporting your liver through fasting or juice detoxing can help restore balance and vitality Fasting has been shown to trigger remarkable processes in the body, such as detoxification and neurogenesis (the creation of new brain cells) During fasting, the digestive system takes a break, allowing the body to redirect energy toward cleansing and healing. Barbara O\u2019Neill, a renowned natural health expert, describes the liver as the \u201cproject manager\u201d of detoxification. This process occurs in three phases: What Happens During Fasting? 1. Phase One: Fat-soluble toxins are converted into metabolites, which are highly reactive and produce free radicals. 2. Phase Two: Metabolites are neutralized by antioxidants and amino acids, transforming them into water-soluble compounds. 3. Phase Three: Water-soluble toxins are eliminated through sweat, urine, and bowel movements. To support these detoxification phases, it\u2019s crucial to consume nutrient-dense juices, such as juices rich in beta-carotenes (e.g., carrots and leafy greens), vitamin C, vitamin E, and minerals like those found in Celtic sea salt. So a juice detox can be a valuable addition to a non-toxic lifestyle, providing your liver with a much-needed break while delivering an influx of nutrients to support its function. Fasting Tips for Beginners:  Start with regular intermittent fasting instead of prolonged fasts to avoid overwhelming your body with the release of toxins. Begin with a 1-day juice detox and gradually work up to 3 days as your body adjusts. Further Experts and reading:  Dr. Valter Longo: \u201cPeriodic fasting reboots the immune system and promotes cellular regeneration.\u201d Book: The Longevity Diet  Start Small: Try a 1-day juice detox and work up to 3 days as your body adjusts for greater benefits Choose Organic Ingredients: Choose organic products like carrots, beets, cucumbers, celery, spinach, lemon and ginger to support liver function and digestion. Include Protein: Add a plant-based protein source, such as pea protein or hemp protein powder, to your juices. This provides the amino acids necessary for the liver\u2019s detoxification process and helps to neutralize toxins. Avoid Toxins: During your fast, steer clear of caffeine, alcohol, and processed foods to maximize the benefits. Add detox foods daily: If juicing isn\u2019t for you, incorporate liver-supporting foods into your meals, such as leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli and kale), or green teas, which naturally promote liver health. Did you know you can train your body to better handle stress and grow stronger with hormesis - which is exposing yourself to controlled stressors like cold plunges and saunas? Practices like cold\u00a0plunges and sauna sessions are\u00a0excellent examples of hormetic stressors that train your body to\u00a0adapt, grow stronger, and better handle physical and mental stress. These practices not\u00a0only boost resilience but also\u00a0enhance immunity, cardiovascular health, and mental clarity. Research supports the powerful benefits of these practices: Sauna Use: A study published in\u00a0JAMA Internal Medicine\u00a0found that regular sauna use (4\u20137 times per week) reduces cardiovascular-related mortality by 40%. Cold Exposure: Cold water immersion at 10\u201315\u00b0C (50\u201360\u00b0F) has been shown to decrease stress and may even slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases\u00a0As Wim Hof, known as the \"Ice Man,\" explains, \u201cCold is a stressor, so if you can control your body\u2019s response to it, you can control stress.\u201d Combine sauna and cold therapy: Alternate between sauna sessions (15\u201320 minutes) and cold plunges (1\u20133 minutes) to boost circulation, reduce inflammation, and enhance resilience. This combination creates a powerful contrast therapy that leaves you feeling refreshed and energized.- I can guarantee you will feel better afterward! Ease into cold exposure: Whilst initially daunting - start with 30 seconds of cold water at the end of your shower, and increase gradually. You will feel energised and it will boost your focus and mood!  Incorporate heat therapy: Add sauna sessions to your routine for a rush of endorphins, maybe after a swim? Remember to listen to your body and avoid overdoing it - moderation is key! Pro Tips for Hormetic Practices Hydration Is Key: Always hydrate before and after sauna or cold therapy sessions to replenish lost fluids. Make It Routine: Aim for 2\u20133 sessions per week for consistent benefits. Further Experts and Reading:Dr. Andrew Huberman : \u201cDeliberate cold exposure increases dopamine by 250%, leading to enhanced mood and focus.\u201d Dr. Rhonda Patrick: \u201cHeat exposure through sauna use has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality by up to 40%.\u201d  When sleep suffers, everything in life feels harder. Quality sleep is essential for mental clarity, hormone regulation, and immune function, and is a cornerstone of holistic health and overall well-being. Dr. Michael Twery, a sleep experat the NIH, emphasizes that \u201cSleep affects every tissue in our bodies. It impacts growth and stress hormones, our immune system, appetite, breathing, blood pressure, and cardiovascular health.\u201d We as adults typically need at least 8 hours of sleep per night, while children and teenagers require even more to support their development. Poor sleep or irregular sleep patterns can disrupt circadian rhythms\u2014the body\u2019s internal clock\u2014which can lead to cognitive impairments, memory issues, emotional instability, and even chronic health conditions like hypertension or cardiovascular disease Prioritizing high-quality sleep is one of the most impactful habits for your holistic health!  Create a tech-free evening ritual: Avoid screens 1-2 hours before bed to reduce blue light exposure. I personally do yoga or meditation before bed to help me unwind and prepare for rest! Optimize your sleep environment:  Use blackout curtains maintain a cool room temperature (around 18\u201320\u00b0C or 65\u201368\u00b0F) and invest in a comfortable bed with breathable sheets or even a weighted blanket for better sleep quality - it's worth it to optimize sleep length and quality. Minimize noise with earplugs or white noise machines if necessary. Try Holistic sleep aids:  Herbal teas like chamomile or ginger and lemon tea (a fave of mine) before bed are great for relaxation. Magnesium supplements are also great for relaxing the nervous system, and supporting a restful night's sleep too! Experiment with aromatherapy using lavender essential oil to create a calming bedtime atmosphere. Consistency is key: Going to bed and waking up at the same time daily  (yes, even on weekends) helps regulate your circadian rhythm and makes your sleep more restorative too. Pro Tips for Better Sleep Limit Caffeine: Avoid caffeine in the afternoon or evening as it can interfere with your ability to fall asleep. Time Your Meals: Finish eating at least 2\u20133 hours before bedtime to prevent disruptions caused by digestion. Incorporate Physical Activity: Regular exercise improves sleep quality but avoid intense workouts close to bedtime as they may keep you awake. Further Reading and Experts: Dr. Matthew Walker  \u201cSleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day.\u201d Book: Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams Breathwork is a powerful and accessible tool for improving physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It involves intentional breathing techniques that regulate the autonomic nervous system, optimize oxygen flow, and help manage stress and anxiety. Dr. Andrew Huberman highlights breathwork\u2019s ability to rapidly lower stress and increase focus by balancing oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the body. Why It Matters Physiological Regulation: Proper breathing calms the sympathetic nervous system (fight-or-flight) and activates the parasympathetic (rest-and-digest). Regulates parasympathetic vs sympathetic activation, crucial for hormone harmony. Oxygen Optimization: Techniques like connected (circular) breathing ensure continuous oxygen flow, which can stabilize mood and energy levels. Stress & Anxiety Control: Techniques like box breathing (4-4-4-4) quickly calm racing thoughts and reduce perceived stress. Research in\u00a0Sleep Science\u00a0(2020) revealed that box breathing reduces sympathetic arousal, helping individuals fall asleep faster and achieve deeper rest. Cortisol Reduction: a 2019 study in\u00a0BMC Complementary Medicine and Therapies\u00a0demonstrated that daily breathwork significantly lowers cortisol levels, improving subjective well-being. Neuroplasticity: Breathwork promotes positive neuroplasticity by enhancing focus and emotional regulation, as supported by studies on mindfulness practices that incorporate breathing techniques Some Types of Breathwork Connected (Circular) Breathing:  Continuous inhalation and exhalation with no pause in between. Box Breathing (4-4-4-4):  Inhale for 4s, hold 4s, exhale 4s, hold 4s.Particularly helpful before sleep or to manage acute stress. Navy SEALs use this technique to steady nerves under pressure. \u00a0Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana): Involves alternating breaths through each nostril to balance energy flow. Further Readings and Experts Dr. Belisa Vranich: \u201cMost people breathe inefficiently\u2014learning to breathe properly can transform your energy levels.\u201d Book: Breathe: The Simple, Revolutionary 14-Day Program to Improve Your Mental and Physical Health Dr. Andrew Huberman: \u201cControlled breathing directly influences the autonomic nervous system, helping reduce stress and improve focus.\u201d James Nestor : \u201cHow you breathe affects every aspect of your health\u2014your energy, focus, and even longevity.\u201d Book: Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art  Set Aside Time Daily: Dedicate at least 5\u201310 minutes each day to practice breathwork techniques. Incorporate into Your Routine: Use connected breathing in the morning to energize your day. Try box breathing before bed or during moments of high stress to calm your mind. Track Progress: Use mindfulness apps like\u00a0Calm\u00a0or\u00a0Headspace\u00a0to guide your breathwork sessions. Gradually increase practice duration as you become more comfortable. Pro Tips for Maximizing Benefits Combine breathwork with other holistic practices like yoga or meditation for enhanced results. Pair breathwork with grounding exercises such as walking barefoot to amplify relaxation.  Building new habits can feel overwhelming, but it doesn\u2019t have to be! James Clear\u2019s Atomic Habits taught me that small, consistent changes are the secret to making habits stick. Here\u2019s how you can use his tips to embrace holistic habits in a way that feels natural and doable: Make It Obvious: Set up little reminders for yourself. For example, leave your gratitude journal on your pillow so you see it before bed, or place a water bottle on your desk to remind you to stay hydrated. Make It Fun: Pair your habit with something you love! I like to play relaxing music while I do breathwork or enjoy my favorite herbal tea as part of my evening wind-down routine. Start Small: Don\u2019t try to do everything at once. If 10 minutes of meditation feels like too much, start with just 2 minutes\u2014you\u2019ll be surprised how quickly it adds up! Celebrate Your Wins: Give yourself credit for showing up, even if it\u2019s just a small step. Did you take a short walk today? Amazing! That\u2019s progress worth celebrating. The key is to focus on small, manageable steps and make them enjoyable. Over time, these tiny changes can create a ripple effect that transforms your life in ways you never imagined!  When I look back at my own journey, I'm amazed at how these simple habits have transformed not just my health, but my entire perspective on wellbeing. What started as small changes \u2013 a morning meditation here, a mindful meal there \u2013 has blossomed into a way of life that feels natural and nurturing. From my experience supporting others in their wellness journeys, I've seen how starting small creates lasting change. You don't need to revolutionize your life overnight. Perhaps you'll begin with a morning walk in nature, letting the sunrise reset your rhythm.. Or you might find peace in a few minutes of mindful breathing between meetings. The beauty of these holistic habits lies in their ripple effect \u2013 as one area of your life transforms, others naturally follow. Your improved sleep leads to better food choices. Your daily movement practice brings mental clarity. Your gratitude practice deepens relationships.  It's all beautifully interconnected! Remember, this it is not about perfection but progress and listening to your body. Start where you are, with what calls to you most. Trust that each small step forward creates positive change, and celebrate your journey toward a more balanced, vibrant life. I'd love to hear which habit resonates most with you, or what questions you have as you begin exploring holistic living. Share your thoughts in comments! Master mindfulness: Incorporate meditation or practice being fully present in everyday moments. Mindfulness can help reduce stress and improve focus, creating a sense of calm and clarity. Nourish your body: Shift your mindset to see food as medicine and fuel. Prioritize vibrant, whole, plant-based foods, and consider incorporating intermittent fasting or nutrient-dense juices to support your health. Move your body every day: Engage in enjoyable daily movements like walking, yoga, or bodyweight exercises to boost physical health, reduce stress, and enhance mental well-being. Practice gratitude and self-compassion: Reflect on the positives in your life through gratitude journaling or bedtime reflections. Pair this with self-care rituals to nurture kindness toward yourself. Go outdoors and connect with nature: Spend at least 20 minutes in green spaces daily to lower cortisol levels, clear your mind, and feel more grounded. Foster healthy relationships: Strengthen meaningful connections by investing time in loved ones, practicing active listening, and joining communities that align with your interests. Take time away from screens: Unplug from the digital world by creating screen-free zones or scheduling detox days. Use this time to engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Incorporate hot and cold exposure: Build resilience by alternating between cold plunges and sauna sessions. These practices improve circulation, reduce inflammation, and boost adaptability. Prioritize restful sleep: Treat sleep as a cornerstone of health by creating a calming bedtime routine, optimizing your sleep environment, and aiming for 7\u20138 hours of quality rest each night. Practice breathwork: Harness the power of intentional breathing techniques like box breathing or connected breathing to reduce stress instantly, improve focus, and enhance emotional balance.

Learn more \u2192 \u00a0 Have you ever picked up a beauty product and felt overwhelmed by the long list of unfamiliar ingredients on the label? You're not alone. The world of cosmetics can feel overwhelming. In today's world of information overload, deciphering what's in our cosmetics can feel like taking a crash course in chemistry. But there's a key to unlocking this mystery: the INCI list. INCI, which stands for International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients, is a standardized system for naming cosmetic ingredients. It's essentially a universal language for cosmetic formulations, designed to bring clarity to consumers worldwide. Whether you're examining a moisturizer in New York, a sunscreen in Paris, or a face mask in Tokyo, the INCI list ensures that ingredients are named consistently across all products and borders. But why does this matter to you? The INCI list is your roadmap to making informed choices about the products you use daily. It's the difference between blindly trusting marketing claims and truly knowing what you're applying to your skin. Through this article, you will learn how to face cosmetic ingredient lists head-on and navigate those tricky components like a pro, identify ingredients that benefit your skin, and recognize those you might want to avoid. So, are you ready to become fluent in the language of cosmetic ingredients?  The INCI List is a roadmap to understanding what is in your cosmetic products. With over 25000 ingredients listed for use in personal and cosmetic care, it can be difficult to decipher what is what. The International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients is an internationally recognized system used in the EU, USA, China, Japan, and many other countries. It provides standardized names for manufacturers and companies to list on their cosmetic product labels. Maintaining a clear understanding of INCI names helps you know exactly what ingredients are in the products you use. For example, water is always listed as \"Aqua,\" olive oil as \"Olea Europaea Oil,\" and vitamin E as \"Tocopherol.\" This standardization helps consumers identify ingredients across different products and brands, regardless of their location or the product's origin. So its main purpose is to help you understand what you are putting on your skin, offering clarity and transparency. However, there are drawbacks. Just because an ingredient is on the list doesn\u2019t mean it is approved or safe. \u00a0 The American trade association, the Personal Care Products Council established the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients list in 1973. As the cosmetic industry exploded with new products, confusion around the cosmetic ingredients used also erupted. Before the creation of the INCI list, brands used different names for the same ingredients, making it hard to identify what you were using and confusing to compare products. The original handbook, the Common Ingredient Dictionary, published by the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association, sought to soothe the chaos. It soon gained international recognition and remains a standard for cosmetic labeling in many countries throughout the world. \u00a0\u00a0 Transparency. That\u2019s the biggest reason. When you pick up a face serum, you want to know what\u2019s inside, especially if you are passionate about clean beauty, want to uphold values or avoid allergens. The International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients list is the first step in figuring out what is in your much-loved products. By listing all the ingredients in a product, it expands your world of understanding. But, to make a healthy choice, you shouldn\u2019t stop there. Long chemical-sounding names, Latin names, it can all be a bit bewildering. For example, an ingredient like hyaluronic acid might sound harsh, but it's actually a naturally occurring substance in your skin that helps retain moisture. It is often used in clean beauty products. The INCI list is overflowing with aligned names for ingredients, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily explain what they are or disclose their origin. \u00a0 By listing every ingredient, the INCI List provides an element of consumer safety. It helps you avoid allergens, irritants, or ingredients that don\u2019t align with your values, like parabens, preservatives, or artificial fragrances. However, it is vital to research each ingredient. Check out what new laws are in place, and look for clean beauty certificates, such as Leaping Bunny or EWG. These certifications can provide assurance that the product has been manufactured adhering to specific regulations and can give you a better idea of what you are buying. \u00a0 While INCI lists are incredibly useful, it's important to understand their limitations: They don't indicate the quality or source of ingredients. They don't specify whether an ingredient is natural or synthetic. They don't provide information about the manufacturing process. Some ingredients, like fragrances, can be listed generically without detailing specific components. Understanding these limitations is crucial for making fully informed decisions about your cosmetic products. There is a huge difference between reading what\u2019s in your tin of baked beans and what is in the hand cream you were gifted for Christmas.\u00a0 It can be hard to know where to start. How do you decipher long, complicated \u2018chemical names\u2019 or ingredient lists that look like they belong in the last century?\u00a0If you are unsure where to begin, simply start at the beginning. The first and most crucial thing to remember is that ingredients are listed in descending order of concentration. The first few ingredients make up the bulk of the product. This applies to both FDA-regulated products and European Union products. This means: The first 5-6 ingredients typically make up 80-90% of the product Ingredients listed after the first 5-6 are usually present in small amounts (less than 1%). Ingredients at 1% or less concentration can be listed in any order. Color additives can be listed at the end, regardless of concentration. Most cosmetic products are water-based or oil-based. Look for these common bases: Water-based: \"Aqua\" (water) is usually the first ingredient. Oil-based: Look for oils like \"Helianthus Annuus Seed Oil\" (Sunflower Oil) or \"Cocos Nucifera Oil\" (Coconut Oil) near the top of the list.  Familiarize yourself with common ingredients and their functions. For example: Glycerin: A humectant that attracts moisture to the skin. Cetearyl Alcohol: An emollient and thickener (despite the \"alcohol\" in its name, it's not drying). Tocopherol: Vitamin E, an antioxidant. Active ingredients are the star performers in a product. They're often listed by their scientific names. Some examples: Niacinamide: Vitamin B3, good for brightening and reducing pores. Salicylic Acid: A beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) used for acne treatment. Be aware of ingredients that might not agree with your skin: Fragrances: Listed as \"Parfum\" or \"Fragrance\" Common preservatives: Parabens, phenoxyethanol Sulfates: Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) or Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) Pro Tip: If you have sensitive skin or known allergies, always patch-test new products. While not always straightforward, you can often spot natural ingredients by their Latin names: Lavandula Angustifolia: Lavender Butyrospermum Parkii: Shea Butter Simmondsia Chinensis: Jojoba Synthetic ingredients often have chemical-sounding names, but remember, not all synthetic ingredients are harmful, and not all natural ingredients are beneficial for everyone. For example, \"Sodium Hyaluronate\" is just the INCI name for hyaluronic acid, a beneficial skincare ingredient. There are numerous ingredients decoder apps and websites that can help you decode INCI lists. Some popular ones include: EWG's Skin Deep Database Think Dirty App CosDNA These tools can provide quick information about ingredients and their potential effects. With an abundance of personal care products on the market, it would be hard to know and memorize every single ingredient. Here is a breakdown of some key ingredients to love, to be wary of, and to avoid. Hydrators and Moisturizers Glycerin (Glycerol): A powerful humectant that attracts moisture to the skin. Hyaluronic Acid (Sodium Hyaluronate): Holds up to 1000 times its weight in water, providing intense hydration. Ceramides: Lipids that help maintain the skin barrier and lock in moisture. Antioxidants Tocopherol: Vitamin E, protects against free radical damage. Ascorbic Acid: Vitamin C, brightens skin and boosts collagen production. Niacinamide: Vitamin B3, improves skin texture and reduces pore size. Exfoliants Glycolic Acid: An alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) that promotes cell turnover. Salicylic Acid: A beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) that unclogs pores, great for acne-prone skin. Lactic Acid: A gentle AHA suitable for sensitive skin. Soothing Agents Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice: Calms irritated skin and provides hydration. Panthenol: Pro-vitamin B5, helps soothe and heal the skin. Allantoin: Calms and protects sensitive skin. Plant Oils and Butters Simmondsia Chinensis Seed Oil: Jojoba oil, similar to skin's natural sebum. Butyrospermum Parkii Butter: Shea butter, rich in fatty acids and vitamins. Cocos Nucifera Oil: Coconut oil, has antimicrobial properties (but can be comedogenic for some).  Be cautious (or simply avoid) harmful ingredients such as parabens, sulfates, or silicones. Used as preservatives, evidence is emerging that parabens such as methylparaben have the potential to be carcinogenic. Silicones, used in cosmetic products, may become toxic; cyclosiloxanes are known as Bio-accumulative. Through growing your awareness of ingredients, you can make better choices and avoid toxic make-up and skincare products. Preservatives Parabens (e.g., Methylparaben, Propylparaben): Linked to hormone disruption in some studies. Phenoxyethanol: Can irritate in high concentrations. Formaldehyde-releasers (e.g., DMDM Hydantoin): Can be irritating and are potential carcinogens. Sulfates Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS): A harsh cleanser that can strip the skin of natural oils. Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES): Milder than SLS but still potentially irritating for some. Fragrances Parfum/Fragrance: Can cause allergic reactions or irritation in sensitive individuals. Essential Oils: While natural, they can be irritating for some people. Silicones Dimethicone: Creates a smooth feel but can trap bacteria and oil for some skin types. Cyclopentasiloxane: Provides a silky texture but may accumulate in the environment. Chemical Sunscreens Oxybenzone: Potentially hormone-disrupting and harmful to coral reefs. Avobenzone: This can be unstable and irritating for some people. Petrochemicals Mineral Oil (Paraffinum Liquidum): Derived from petroleum, can clog pores for some. Petrolatum: Similar to mineral oil, can be occlusive. Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde-releasing Preservatives Examples: DMDM Hydantoin, Imidazolidinyl Urea, Diazolidinyl Urea Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen, that can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions Potentially toxic when inhaled (more relevant for hair straightening treatments) Phthalates Examples: Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP), Diethyl Phthalate (DEP) Potential endocrine disruptors May increase the risk of hormone-related cancers Alcohols (when high on the ingredient list) Alcohol Denat. (Denatured Alcohol): Can be drying and irritating in high concentrations. Isopropyl Alcohol: Can disrupt the skin barrier if used excessively.  Follow your natural gut feeling. If there are questions surrounding an ingredient, opt for a natural alternative. Synthetic fragrances can result in allergies or skin irritation, so choose a product that has a natural fragrance, derived from essential oils. Certain ingredients present, like Titanium Dioxide can be harmful if inhaled. Although it is a common mineral-based UV filter, avoid using it in loose powders. Decoding INCI lists can seem overwhelming at first. Life is busy and your mind is overflowing with things to do, choices to make, and on top of all that, figure out what\u2019s for dinner. But, you have that nagging feeling that just understanding a few ingredients might mean better choices for you and your family. Take it slowly, start simple, and then dive deeper. Don\u2019t let complicated names put you off. The INCI lists often have ingredient names that resemble the elements common name. Once you have grasped a few basics you will be on the way. Let\u2019s explore some basics and understand when you might need to probe a bit more.\u00a0 Water is vital for survival and is pretty high up on the INCI ingredient list. Often the first ingredient, Aqua or water, is used in many products, from serums to cleansers. Water not only hydrates but acts as a solvent for other elements like humectants and emulsifiers. \u00a0\u00a0 You might not think you can go wrong with water, but a drawback of the INCI list is the inability to know the quality of the water. Is it purified or distilled? Botanicals or plants are a great place to start. Botanical ingredients can be plant extracts, leaves, roots, seeds herbs, or flowers. These botanical ingredients follow specific INCI guidelines using their Latin botanical names. The vivid orange marigold is Calendula Officinalis while the gentle rose is recognised by Rosa Damascena. At first, these names can appear foreign, but through time, you will begin to distinguish them. If you gravitate towards plant-based products, picking a few to learn each week can be helpful. Caution:\u00a0It is good to remember that while the ingredient may be listed as a plant name, the INCI list won't tell you if it is in a natural state or chemically altered. For example, coconut oil, listed as Cocos Nucifera, could be raw coconut oil or a synthetic derivative made from coconut oil.\u00a0 Fragrance or perfume can be tricky to decipher as it can come from natural sources like essential oils or from synthetic chemicals designed to mimic natural scents. The term \"parfum\" doesn't specify which. This lack of transparency can be problematic, especially if you're sensitive to synthetic fragrances or trying to avoid them. An exception is found in organic cosmetic products. Within this range, parfum must be natural or derived from essential oils. Take it slow: Learn a few ingredients at a time Focus on the first 5-6 ingredients: These make up the bulk of the product Look for familiar terms: Many INCI names resemble common names Use resources: Ingredient databases and apps can help decode complex names Be aware of dual nature: Some ingredients (like Cocos Nucifera/Coconut Oil) can be natural or synthetic derivatives Check the product purpose: Different products will have different key ingredients Be mindful of concentrations: Ingredients are listed in descending order of concentration Research unfamiliar ingredients: When in doubt, look up unknown ingredients Consider your skin type: What works for others may not work for you Remember, understanding INCI lists is a journey. As you become more familiar with common ingredients, you'll find it easier to make informed decisions about your skincare and cosmetic products.  Understanding the INCI list and its limitations can give you control over your choices. It helps you avoid ingredients that may not be beneficial to your health and embrace those that will. You don\u2019t have to have a chemistry degree to read the ingredient lists on your favorite toiletry or the conditioning mask your split ends crave. You need to know what to look out for. So, the next time you are standing in the cosmetic aisle, choosing a new product, make that choice with confidence. You are armed with the ability to decipher INCI lists, how to simplify the chaos of words, and make better choices for your skincare and health.

Neither did I until I learned about BPA in clothing, especially in my sports bras. Like most people, I focused on comfort, price, and style, completely unaware of the hidden chemicals and toxic clothing lurking in my wardrobe. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a stubborn chemical that persists in the environment and can accumulate in human tissues. It is typically associated with plastics, including water bottles and other consumer products. But more recently, BPA has silently made its way into the textile industry, especially in sportswear, as sports bras and athletic shirts, leggings etc. Shockingly, a 2023 report revealed that clothing could expose you up to 40 times the safe limit of BPA under California law. The rise of fast fashion has contributed to the increased prevalence of BPA in clothing. But don't panic - let's unpack what clothing items BPA can be found and how to protect yourself! BPA, is a synthetic chemical compound commonly found in everyday clothing fabrics like polyester and spandex, and it's used in coatings and dyes during clothing production. Whilst BPA is not a PFAS or 'forever chemical', both of these chemicals persist in the body and the environment. Why? It's known for providing durability, flexibility, and color stability. Unfortunately, BPA can absorb through your skin, especially when exposed to heat and when worn for hours at a time - think athletic wear during a sweaty workout! Even recycled polyester, noted as a 'eco-friendly' alternative, often contains significant BPA contamination, due to its origins in recycled plastics. The biggest problem with BPA is that it's an endocrine disruptor, similar to other chemicals found in a wealth of products, including phthalates, formaldehyde, etc. These chemicals mimic estrogen in the body, binding to estrogen receptors in the body, sending incorrect signals in the body, and messing with your natural hormone regulation and endocrine system. This can lead to health issues as: Reproductive Harm: BPA has been linked to reduced fertility in both men and women, and a higher risk of polycystic ovarian syndrome in women Increased Cancer Risk: Studies have found associations between BPA exposure and increased risk of kidney, prostate, breast and testicular cancers Pregnancy complications: High blood pressure during pregnancy has potential risks to fetal development European Environment Agency states \"BPA can harm human health due its properties as an endocrine disruptor, it can alter how the hormone system functions. It can damage the reproductive system and negatively affect the immune system\". Through the rise of ultra-fast fashion brands, BPA sneaks into our clothes and even children's clothing through: Synthetic fibres:  Clothing made from polyester, and polycarbonate plastics are the primary culprits Recycled materials: Whilst recycling is great for the planet, recycled polyester often has higher BPA concentration dye to the recycling process and processing, such as dye-fixing and heat treatments, causing the BPA to leach out of the fabric Fabric coatings and dyes: BPA is added to fabrics to improve durability, water resistance, and the overall 'finish' of the material, especially in activewear Director of the Illegal Toxic Threats program at the Center for Environmental Health, Kaya Sugerman says \"People should not be exposed to toxic chemicals in their clothing. Nor should they bear the burden of knowing which brands could harm your health and which will not\". Activewear is a hotbed for BPA. Synthetic fabrics like spandex and polyester are staples in activewear. A recent study found alarming levels of harmful chemicals, including BPA, in activewear from 19 different brands, including sports bras, gym leggings, and yoga pants. Some exceeded safe exposure limits, with brands like FILA, New Balance, Free People, Activ Pro, and even Patagonia. Luckily there are non-toxic activewear brands that offer BPA-free gym wear including Reprise activewear, Triples, Pact, Icebreaker etc. ranging from non-toxic sports bras, to cotton leggings etc. When it comes to BPA exposure, some groups of people are particularly vulnerable to its harmful effects Infants and children - Little ones are especially vulnerable. Their skin is sensitive, absorbing chemicals more easily. Putting their developing bodies at risk to BPA Pregnant individuals - Not just you, but your baby is also at a higher risk of the effects of BPA exposure, as it can cross the placenta, potentially affecting fetal development. Athletes - The combination of synthetic and coated fabrics is a recipe for heat, sweat, and friction, which can enhance and speed up the release of BPA, making prolonged exposure more concerning. Across various countries, regulations on BPA in clothing vary widely. There are wide regulatory gaps highlighted below which increase the need for stronger protection and greater accountability for manufacturers. United States: the FDA and EPA primarily focus on BPA in food-related products but overall have minimal oversight on textiles. There are no comprehensive federal regulations limits to use in clothing European Union: In contrast, the EU has enforced more stringent restrictions when it comes to BPAs and has enforced bans on BPA in baby clothing and infants, due to their increased vulnerability Other countries:  Unfortunately, most countries lack specific legal limits for BPA in clothing, which makes consumers vulnerable to increased BPA exposure. We are all about making smarter choices for our health and the planet, with this in mind. Here's how you can reduce your exposure to BPA whilst maintaining a stylish and sustainable wardrobe: Choosing sustainable fibers and untreated fabrics: opt for wool, hemp, cotton, bamboo, or other untreated natural fibers. These sustainable materials not only kind to your skin but are also free from the hidden risks of synthetic fabrics Avoid recycled polyester and heavily coated/dyed fabrics: Recycled doesn't always mean safer. Look for untreated, or minimally processed options. Opt for Plant-Based Dyes: Natural dyes extracted from plant materials like teak leaves, coffee leaves, or agricultural waste are gaining traction as replacements for synthetic dyes. Look for trusted certifications: Eco-labels like OEKO-TEX or GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) are trustworthy guides to ensure your clothes are free from BPA and other harmful chemicals. If you are unsure read the label or ask the brand! Embrace resale and upcycling: secondhand clothing and upcycling practices reduce demand for new textiles made with harmful substances like BPA.  When trying to avoid harmful substances like BPA, keep an eye out for terms that include 'BPA-free' or 'chemical-free' and these trusted certifications. These indicators are your shortcuts to safer and smarter labels to look out for when avoiding BPA in clothing If you're aware your clothing contains BPA and are not ready to part ways with it, here are some tips when it comes to caring for and minimizing your BPA exposure Washing with care: Lower temperatures are better when washing synthetic clothing, as higher temperatures can encourage BPAs and other chemicals to leach out Do not skip post-workout laundry: Sweat, heat, and friction can increase the release of BPA from fabrics. Washing workout clothes promptly after exercise can help reduce your exposure Looking to make a clean break from BPA? Luckily, there are amazing brands, that offer organic, natural, and chemical-free clothing options Explore organic brands: Look for brands that specialize in organic, untreated, or BPA-free clothing. Many of these brands focus on natural fibers like organic cotton, hemp, bamboo, and other natural alternatives. Some brands include Pact, MATE the Label, Tentree, People Tree, etc. The clothing industry plays a pivotal role in addressing BPA exposure, and there is a requirement for a push from regulations, advocacy, and consumers demanding change, but there is progress being made: Organisations like the Center for Environmental Health have started to take legal actions against brands found to have high levels of BPA in their activewear, holding manufacturers accountable, and ensuring consumer safety by enforcing stricter complaints with current safety standards Organizations like Greenpeace, Fashion Revolution, and the Environmental Working Group (EWG) are leading efforts to educate everyone on chemical safety in clothing. Campaigns like #WhoMadeMyClothes encourage consumers to ask brands about their manufacturing processes and push for more transparency. BPAs are hiding in your wardrobe: Many synthetic fabrics contain BPAs, a chemical that posses serious health risks. BPAs are especially prevalent in activewear Health risk of BPA exposure: BPA is an endocrine disruptor linked to hormone imbalances, fertility issues, certain cancers, and pregnancy complications. Prolonged skin contact, heat, and sweat can increase exposure Opt for safer choices for your closet: Choose natural fibers like wool, hemp, or organic cotton, and look for eco-certifications like OEKO-TEX and GOTS to ensure BPA-free clothing Take care of what you own: Wash synthetic clothes in cooler temperatures and clean activewear promptly after exercise to minimize BPA release and skin contact. Push for transparency: Advocacy groups and legal actions are pressuring brands to disclose chemical use and to adopt safer practices. Support brands that prioritize transparency and BPA-free products BPA in clothing is not considered safe because it is an endocrine disruptor that can interfere with the body\u2019s hormonal system. Prolonged exposure, especially through synthetic fabrics like polyester and spandex, has been linked to reproductive harm, increased cancer risks, and pregnancy complications. The risk is heightened when BPA-containing clothing is worn during activities that involve heat and sweat, such as exercising, as these conditions can increase BPA absorption through the skin BPA cannot be entirely washed out of clothing because it is often in the fibers or coatings used during production. Washing synthetic fabrics at lower temperatures may reduce the leaching of BPA but does not eliminate it. Additionally, washing at high temperatures or repeated laundering may cause more BPA to leach out over time, potentially contaminating water systems Fabrics most likely to contain BPA include synthetic materials such as polyester, spandex, and other plastics-based textiles. Recycled polyester, often marketed as eco-friendly, can have even higher concentrations of BPA due to its origins in recycled plastics. BPA is also used in coatings and dyes applied to fabrics to improve durability and color stability, making activewear a particularly high-risk category Yes, BPA can be absorbed through the skin. Dermal absorption is a significant route of exposure, especially when the skin comes into contact with BPA-containing materials under conditions of heat, sweat, or friction.

Learn more \u2192 \u00a0 Cleaning your home can feel like an endless (and thankless) chore, but a few small changes can help you go from angry scrubbing to self-care for your sanctuary. One way to do this is to opt for natural cleaners over the harsher commercial alternatives.\u00a0 Natural cleaners usually opt for simpler ingredients, but the non-toxic cleaning solutions available in the store can be expensive and sometimes not even as effective. Thankfully, you can make a quick and easy solution in your own home, using safe and tested ingredients that you can get from any store. In this guide, you'll discover how to make homemade all-purpose natural cleaning recipes and natural alternatives to harsh commercial products. We'll explore easy DIY solutions for every corner of your home, from the kitchen to the bathroom and beyond. Ready to transform your cleaning routine?  Commercial and professional cleaning products often rely on harsh chemicals to get the job done. These include scary substances like ethylene glycol, phosphates, ammonia, bleach, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs in particular have the potential to cause respiratory damage, increase your risk of cancer, or even have developmental and reproductive impacts.\u00a0 If you\u2019ve ever had a hard time breathing while using a commercial spray, you\u2019re not alone. Recent studies have found that employees who use professional cleaning products tend to have more respiratory issues like asthma. Nearly 75% of the products involved were irritants, and over 25% of them were corrosive.\u00a0 While these chemicals can be effective, they\u2019re not the type of substances you want around the areas where you eat and relax. Natural cleaners, on the other hand, offer a gentler and healthier alternative that can keep these sensitive areas clean without the detrimental effects.\u00a0 Making the switch to non-toxic products helps remove these hazards from your home, protect your health, and improve the air quality in your living space by cutting out dangerous chemicals like VOCs.\u00a0 Reduce exposure to harsh chemicals Improve indoor air quality Save money on cleaning products Customize scents with essential oils Reduce plastic waste from cleaning product containers Safe to use around children and pets Yes! For some applications, DIY natural cleaners are a simple alternative that is easier on the environment and your wallet.\u00a0  Baking soda is a staple of nearly all homemade natural cleaners. It's mildly alkaline, which makes it a perfect match against strong odors that come from strong acids (like sour milk). Baking soda neutralizes these odors instead of just covering them up, making it a natural odor absorber and deodorizer. You can even use it to deodorize those plastic food containers that have absorbed stubborn food smells. You can add baking soda to water to make an easy-to-spray solution, or you can sprinkle it on a sponge to use the particulates as a natural abrasive to scrub off stubborn grime. Baking soda is safe and versatile enough to use on glass, chrome, steel, and plastic, which means you can use it nearly everywhere in your home: from your sinks to your tubs, tile, microwaves, and even some fabrics! It\u2019s also non-toxic, which means you can use it around pets and children worry-free. If you need a brand to start with, we recommend \u00a0Bob's Red Mill Baking Soda *  Essential oils are another cornerstone of most natural cleaner recipes, and for good reason.\u00a0 First\u2014they smell good! That may seem obvious, but scent can be a powerful way to upgrade your home. Making your living space smell good not only makes it pleasant, but it can also have therapeutic benefits as well (which is the main idea behind aromatherapy). Certain scents (like lavender) can bring a calming presence to your home\u00a0 Different oils can also have different effects. For example,\u00a0 Tea tree oil and cedarwood oils can help clean soiled laundry. Peppermint oil has antibacterial and antifungal properties that can make it a good disinfectant (while also warding off insects and other pests at the same time).\u00a0 Lemon oil is a common favorite for spot-cleaning wood and leather furniture.\u00a0 You can mix different essential oils to get the scent combination that you prefer\u2014there\u2019s almost never a wrong answer! A little also goes a long way. Add a few drops of oil to your natural cleaner solution and watch how it instantly elevates your cleaning experience. If you\u2019re new to the power of essential oils, sets like the Plant Therapy set* can help get you started.\u00a0 While research is still ongoing, studies indicate that natural cleaners can help disinfect your surfaces\u2014as long as they\u2019re used properly.\u00a0 Natural disinfectants can include alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, hot water, and even some essential oils. These alternatives are often gentler than the commercial options and have been shown to kill certain strains of viruses and bacteria. Hydrogen peroxide can kill viruses and bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). You can use the 3% concentration off the shelf or dilute it down to 0.5%. Leave the solution on the surface for 1 minute before wiping clean. Vinegar (or more specifically, the acetic acid in vinegar) can reduce bacteria. A 2010 study found that 10% malt vinegar can reduce the flu virus, and a subsequent 2014 study found that 10% solution could kill the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. Essential oils like patchouli, peppermint oil, and cinnamon can kill some pathogens. Natural disinfectants generally take longer to take effect and are not always as effective as commercial options (like bleach), However, if you need a gentler alternative, these natural options can help you clear away some pathogens from your day-to-day surfaces.\u00a0  To start your natural cleaning journey on the right foot, be sure to stock your cleaning caddy with these household ingredients first\u00a0 Baking soda Vinegar Washing soda Castile soap (i.e Dr. Bronner's* ) Lemon juice Mason jar Glass spray bottle Funnel (HIGHLY recommended) Non-toxic liquid dish soap (like Dawn) Essential oils (either a kit like Plant Therapy set * or a set of basics: lemon, tea tree, etc) You can pick up most of these ingredients at your local grocery store. Once you\u2019ve compiled your stash, now it\u2019s time to learn how to use these common pantry ingredients to make your cleaners.\u00a0 There are a lot of creative recipes out there, but for your first attempt at making natural cleaner, a simple spray bottle recipe is a great place to start. These homemade cleaners that use glass spray bottles* generally only need two to three ingredients, work on most surfaces, and most importantly, help you get a better understanding of the basics. You\u2019ll get a feel for how these ingredients interact and how much you\u2019ll need.\u00a0 This is especially important when you\u2019re using essential oils. Remember how a little goes a long way? If you accidentally add a few drops too many, you\u2019ll have way more fragrance than you expected. Maybe the oil combination you chose isn\u2019t something you like long-term after all. It\u2019s always better to start small and test out your ideas before making big batches.\u00a0  Often, the best DIY cleaners are deceptively simple. This homemade cleaner can be made in less than five minutes, can be used on nearly all your hard surfaces, and only takes two ingredients: non-toxic liquid dish soap and vinegar.\u00a0\u00a0 For a quick, simple homemade cleaner with non-toxic ingredients, try the following: Microwave (or otherwise warm) a cup of vinegar and then combine it with one cup of dish soap (like Dawn) into a spray bottle. Gently swirl it to mix thoroughly, but DON\u2019T shake it\u2014too much motion will create a bubbly mess.\u00a0 To use, spray liberally on your shower, tub, sink, or other hard surface. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then wipe away to reveal a sparkly clean surprise! Now that we've covered the basics, let's start with the most versatile cleaner in your arsenal.  If you want a natural cleaner that can be used almost anywhere in your home, you'll want to start with an all-purpose cleaning recipe. This type of cleaner can be used on most hard surfaces and even on some stains. Learn how to create an easy homemade all-purpose cleaner recipe using common household ingredients Most natural all-purpose cleaner recipes follow the same formula.\u00a0 1 cup hot water 1 cup vinegar 5 drops of your favorite essential oil (lemon, lavender, and tea tree are all popular options) To make your all-purpose cleaner, go through the following steps: Mix your vinegar and water into your spray bottle. If you like, add a few drops of essential oil to add a pleasant scent. Swirl to mix thoroughly and then you\u2019re ready to clean! Simple, easy, and versatile. You can use this cleaner on your countertops, glass, and even your floors.\u00a0 Essential oils are an easy and potent way to elevate your natural cleaners. You can add your favorite scent to make your home smell amazing, or you can choose various oils for their unique properties. Lemon oil and tea tree oil are popular for cleaning recipes to use on practically any surface.\u00a0 Adding essential oils to your homemade all-purpose cleaner is a piece of cake! Simply add about 5 drops, mix, and apply.\u00a0 With your all-purpose cleaner mastered, let's move on to tackling the toughest rooms in your home. The kitchen and bathroom often require special attention. Here, we'll explore natural oven cleaner alternatives and eco-friendly toilet bowl cleaner solutions that are both effective and safe  You can also make your own dish soap and dishwasher detergent using natural ingredients.  For an alternative to the harsh chemicals in commercial dish soap and dishwasher detergent, try out this natural cleaning recipe: 1 cup washing soda 1 cup baking soda 1 cup salt \u00bc cup citric acid 30 drops lemon essential oil After compiling your ingredients, complete the following steps: Combine your dry ingredients in a mixing bowl and add about 30 drops of essential oil. Mix with a fork until there are no clumps. Store the final mixture in a mason jar or other airtight container.\u00a0 To use your detergent, place a tablespoon of the power in the detergent dispenser of your dishwasher or sprinkle on a damp sponge.\u00a0 No one likes those grimy food particulates that build up inside our oven, but thankfully there\u2019s a natural oven cleaner alternative that can help get your appliance nice and sparkly again! Baking soda is the key ingredient here. Its alkalinity and abrasive nature means that it helps break down the acidic grease and scrubs off stuck-on grit with ease.\u00a0 Start with: \u00bd cup baking soda 3 tablespoons water Then, complete the following: Combine to make a paste (about the same consistency as pancake batter). Remove the racks from your oven and spread the paste over the dirty metal and glass parts of your oven. (Note: avoid your heating elements).\u00a0 Let the mixture sit for 15-20 minutes and then wipe away with a wet paper towel. You can also use a 3:1 mixture of water and distilled vinear for an extra-thorough clean.\u00a0 But how about for those stubbornly clogged drains? The solutions on the market can be harsh on your pipes (and your nose!) Drains often get clogged with old scraps of food and organic matter, which means that once again, baking soda is your friend.\u00a0 For a natural drain cleaner, try this:\u00a0 \u00bd cup baking soda \u00bd cup vinegar \u00bd cup lemon juice (optional) Then you'll want to do the next steps: Start by pouring the baking soda directly into your drain, followed by the vinegar. (If you want a more pleasant fragrance, add your lemon juice). Once the vinegar hits the baking soda, it will start a bubbly reaction that emits CO2. Plug the drain and let the bubbles gently scrub your pipes from the inside.\u00a0 After 10-20 minutes, rinse the drain with hot water and enjoy your freshly unplugged plumbing! Do you have to reach for harsh chemicals to get your toilet or your glass surfaces streak-free and shiny? Not anymore! First, let\u2019s start with this simple two-step spray recipe for a natural homemade toilet bowl cleaner:\u00a0 1 cup vinegar 1-2 tablespoons baking soda Next, continue on to: Pour your vinegar into a spray bottle and spray liberally into your toilet bowl. Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes. Sprinkle your baking soda into the toilet bottle to make a fizzy lather. If desired, scrub the bowl to use the baking soda particulates as a natural abrasive and odor absorber. Flush, and voila!\u00a0 But how about glass cleaner\u2014can natural cleaners stand up to Windex? As it turns out, yes! Try out the following: 3 tbsp white vinegar 2 tbsp rubbing alcohol 1 1/2 cups water Pour your vinegar and rubbing alcohol into a glass spray bottle using a funnel. Slowly add your water and shake it to mix. Next, spray, wipe, and see the difference! Sometimes you need a cleaner tailored to a specific surface or stain. Here are some recipes for those special cleaning challenges Sometimes you need cleaners for specific purposes. In this section, you'll find out how to make a DIY carpet stain remover and natural wood polish spray, among other specialized solutions.  What about those pesky stains that happen on your carpets? Life happens, and when it does, there\u2019s a natural cleaning solution that you can whip up quickly to get those hard-to-get stains out of your carpeting.\u00a0 For a natural carpet stain remover using natural ingredients, try the following:\u00a0 1-2 cups vinegar 1 cup of water 2-3 drops of dye-free dish soap (optional) 2-5 drops of your favorite essential oils\u00a0 Spray bottle\u00a0 From there, complete the following steps: Pour the vinegar into a spray bottle and dilute with 1 cup of water. If you like, add 2 or 3 drops of your liquid dish soap for an extra cleaning kick. Finish off with a few drops of your favorite essential oil for fragrance.\u00a0 Spray generously onto any stain and let it soak for a few minutes. Blot it up with a cloth or paper towel, and watch the mess disappear. In a pinch, you can simply add dry baking soda onto your fresh carpet stain. Baking soda can help break down the spill, although it will take some time. Pour a layer of baking soda on the stain and rub it into the fibers before leaving it to sit for a few hours (or even overnight). Vacuum up the powder to finish.\u00a0 What if your carpet just needs a little freshening in between shampoos? You can make an easy carpet freshener by combining one cup of baking soda with 10-30 drops of essential oil. Mix evenly and then disperse the powder over your carpet before vacuuming to absorb lingering odors and leave your carpets pleasantly fresh.\u00a0  Wood can be a sensitive substance to clean, but there are natural options.\u00a0 For an easy wood polishing spray combine:\u00a0 1 1/2 \u2013 3/4 cup distilled water 1/8 -1/4 cup white vinegar 2 tablespoons olive oil 20 drops of lemon essential oil\u00a0 Pour all ingredients into a glass spray bottle and swirl to mix. To use, spray directly onto your wood surfaces and floors and wine away with a wood polish rag or microfiber cloth.\u00a0 If you need an easy dusting spray, start with:\u00a0 \u00bd cup white vinegar 2 cups warm water \u00bc cup olive oil\u00a0 2-5 drops of essential oil (optional) Next, complete the following: Combine all ingredients into a glass spray bottle. After wiping away excess dust with a microfiber cloth, spray the mixture onto your surfaces. This will both collect any hidden dust particles and create a natural barrier to stop dust from collecting.\u00a0 While you can often clean natural stones like granite with just a damp sponge, sometimes you need something a little extra to get up the grime. In those cases, try this simple recipe:\u00a0 \u00bc cup rubbing alcohol 3-5 drops liquid dish soap 1\u00bd cups distilled water 5-10 drops essential oils (optional)\u00a0 To make this cleaner, complete the following: Combine the alcohol, dish soap, and essential oils into a spray bottle and swirl together.

Lately, the conversation around the hidden dangers of conventional cleaning products among other common household products is growing louder. With increasing awareness about health, safety, and overall well-being\u2014especially for families with young children\u2014the idea of exposing ourselves and our loved ones to potentially harmful chemicals is unsettling. In this article, we'll explore the best nontoxic cleaning products but also the benefits of green cleaning products, why they matter, and how making this switch can pave our way to a clean and healthy home.

These toxic substances also negatively impact the environment by contaminating water sources and harming wildlife. Switching to non toxic cleaning products is essential for these reasons: Healthier Indoor Air: A green cleaning product reduces indoor air pollution, leading to fewer respiratory problems and a healthier home. Safe for Children and Pets: These products are free from harsh chemicals, making them safer for children and pets, who are more vulnerable to toxic substances. Environmental Protection: Many non-toxic cleaners are biodegradable and less harmful to the environment, reducing water pollution and minimizing the impact on wildlife. Reduced Allergies and Irritations: Using non-toxic products can lower the risk of skin irritations and allergic reactions caused by the harsh chemicals in conventional cleaners. Absolutely! Non-toxic cleaners use natural ingredients that are both safe and effective. Plant-based ingredients like vinegar, essential oils, and plant-derived surfactants clean as well as, if not better than, traditional agents. Similarly, using non-toxic detergents ensures your laundry is free from harmful chemicals, providing a healthier environment for your family. Here\u2019s a list of some of the natural ingredients you'll find on labels and what they do: Vinegar: Disinfectant and deodorizer, cuts grease, and removes odors. Essential Oils: Antibacterial, antifungal, and aromatic properties. Tea Tree Oil: Antibacterial and antifungal. Lemon Oil: Antimicrobial with a fresh scent. Lavender Oil: Antibacterial with a calming scent. Plant Extracts like Eucalyptus Extract: Provide Antibacterial and various cleaning benefits. Decyl glucoside, Coco glucoside: Mild surfactants that cleanse without irritation. Citric Acid: Natural preservative and pH adjuster, removes hard water stains and soap scum.  It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with some of the common harmful ingredients found in cleaning products so that you know what to look for when reading labels. Phthalates: Found in synthetic fragrances, disrupt hormones. Triclosan: In antibacterial soaps, can affect thyroid function. Ammonia: Irritates respiratory system, worsens asthma. Chlorine: Triggers allergies, asthma; toxic fumes when mixed. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS): Irritates skin/eyes, potential organ toxicity. 2-Butoxyethanol: In window cleaners, can cause severe organ damage. Perchloroethylene (PERC): Carcinogen, harms central nervous system. Formaldehyde: Causes respiratory issues, skin irritation Properly storing natural cleaning products is essential to maintain their effectiveness and ensure safety. Keep Original Containers: Store in original containers with labels intact. Cool, Dry Place: Avoid heat and moisture. Secure Lids: Ensure containers are sealed properly. Childproof Storage: Keep out of reach of children and pets, ideally in a locked cabinet or on a high shelf. For all our DIY'ers, here's an all-purpose cleaner recipe that's great for quick clean-ups. 1 cup white vinegar 1 cup water 1 tablespoon Castile soap 2 tablespoons lemon juice 10-15 drops essential oil (e.g., tea tree, lavender, or lemon) Mix the white vinegar, water, Castile soap, and lemon juice in a spray bottle. Add the essential oil drops. Shake well before each use. Spray on surfaces and wipe with a clean cloth.

(For more tips on non-toxic baby care products, check out this helpful guide on organic natural baby care products ) Shop Branch Basics here*  Image @Branch Basics Despite their benefits, there are several misconceptions about non-toxic laundry detergents: Less Effective: Many believe non-toxic detergents don\u2019t clean as well as conventional ones. However, natural ingredients like enzymes and plant-based surfactants can be just as effective. And we have loads of clean cloth diapers to prove it! Expensive: While some non-toxic detergents can be pricier, many affordable options are available, costing just pennies per load. Limited Availability: With growing awareness, non-toxic laundry detergents are becoming more widely available in stores and online. Non-toxic laundry detergents come in various forms, each with its own benefits: Laundry Strips: Thin, dissolvable strips that you place directly in the wash. Laundry Pods: Pre-measured capsules that dissolve in the washing machine. Liquid: Traditional liquid form, easy to measure and use. Powder: A dry option that can be scooped directly into the wash. Soap nuts: A plastic-free, wild harvested nut that contains cleansing properties to clean clothes. The detergent forms, like sheets or pods,\u00a0 often contain polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a synthetic plastic polymer. While marketed as sustainable due to its water solubility, PVA doesn\u2019t fully degrade in real-life conditions, potentially contaminating waterways and soil. Therefore, we prefer laundry tablets without packaging, liquid detergent, powder or our favorite soap nuts for an eco-friendlier choice.  When selecting a non-toxic laundry detergent, consider these tips: 1. Check for Certifications: Look for products certified by reputable organizations such as USDA Organic, EWG Verified, and EcoCert. 2. Read Ingredient Labels: Ensure the detergent lists all ingredients and avoid those with harmful chemicals. 3. Research the Brand: Choose brands with a commitment to sustainability and transparency. Non-toxic laundry detergent uses a variety of natural ingredients that are safe and effective. Here are some commonly found in top brands: Soap Nuts: A natural fruit with cleaning properties, soap nuts are biodegradable and hypoallergenic. Plant-Based Enzymes: Naturally occurring proteins that break down stains and organic matter. Essential Oils: Provide natural fragrance and antibacterial properties. Mineral-Based Cleaners: Like baking soda and washing soda, these help to neutralize odors and soften water for better cleaning. Plant-Based Surfactants: Derived from renewable resources, these surfactants lift dirt and stains without harmful residues. To ensure safety and environmental friendliness, avoid laundry detergents containing: Phthalates: Commonly used to carry fragrances, phthalates can disrupt endocrine functions. Optical Brighteners: Chemicals that make fabrics appear brighter but can cause skin irritation and are not biodegradable. Phosphates: These can cause environmental damage by promoting algae growth in waterways, which depletes oxygen for marine life. Synthetic Fragrances: Often contain harmful chemicals that can cause skin irritation and respiratory issues. Chlorine Bleach: A strong irritant that can produce toxic fumes and harm fabrics. Sulfates: These can strip natural oils from fabrics and skin, leading to dryness and irritation. PEGs (Polyethylene Glycols): Made through ethoxylation, which can contaminate products with ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen. Benziothiazolinone / Methylisothiazolinone: Toxic to the lungs and brain.  Image micheile henderson on Unsplash For those who prefer homemade solutions, here\u2019s a simple recipe for non-toxic laundry detergent: Ingredients: 1 cup of baking soda 1 cup of washing soda 1 bar of grated castile soap 20 drops of essential oil (e.g., lavender, tea tree) Instructions: Mix all ingredients in a large bowl. Store in an airtight container. Use 1-2 tablespoons per load. This DIY natural recipe is easy to make, customizable, and ensures your laundry detergent is free from harmful chemicals. Health and Environmental Benefits: Non-toxic laundry detergents reduce exposure to harmful chemicals, are gentler on the skin, and environmentally friendly due to biodegradable ingredients and eco-conscious packaging. Effectiveness and Misconceptions: Despite common misconceptions, non-toxic detergents clean just as effectively as conventional ones, using natural ingredients like enzymes and plant-based surfactants. Choosing and Using: Look for certifications like USDA Organic and EWG Verified, read ingredient labels carefully, and consider making your own DIY non-toxic detergent to ensure safety and effectiveness.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a common challenge in homes due to their widespread use across a variety of products, from scented paraffin candles to fresh paint that we use to decorate our homes. Understanding VOCs is crucial for creating a truly healthy home environment. Achieving pure air by reducing VOC exposure is essential for optimal air quality and well-being. The good news is clearing your home of VOCs is totally doable! Over the years, I\u2019ve learned how transformative even opening the windows and having plants could have on my air quality. With a few adjustments, you too can also improve your indoor air quality and create a space that\u2019s safer for you and everyone who walks through your door! Let\u2019s dive into how you can reduce VOCS in your home today and implement small changes you can make today to improve your air quality, your health and make your living area a non-toxic space!  Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are man-made toxic chemicals that are emitted as gases from certain solids of liquids, found in thousands of products that we use daily. They contaminate our indoor and outdoor air, and our water supplies, disruption our health and our environment. VOCs are up to 10 times higher indoors, compared to outdoor air, this is likely due to contributing common consumer products e.g. cleaning products, paints and building materials etc. which accumulate indoors and in situations of poor ventilation struggle to be removed. The most common VOCs used today are: Benzene found in tobacco, fuel and paint supplies. This known carcinogen is often elevated in smokers homes Formaldehyde serves a purpose in the manufacturing of many products, and is often used as a preservative in paints and to coat wood products, and is usually a component of glues and adhesives Toluene is a chemical derived from petroleum and used in many products as a solvent in paints, adhesives, and even nail polishes! Xylene is commonly found in adhesives, coatings and in industrial strength cleaners, this is also found in vapes too Styrene is found in cigarette smoke, and is used in the production of certain plastics and foams, and is a popular product for insulating homes  As many VOCs are odourless and you can't see them, we often don't think about them - however, just because you can't see them, does not mean they're not there! While their invisible nature might make them seem harmless, scientific research has shown that VOC exposure can impact our health in various ways. Nose and throat discomfort Eye and respiratory tract irritation Headaches, dizziness, fatigue or nausea Allergic skin reaction Asthma including throat irritation and wheezing Cancer Liver and kidney damage Central nervous system damage Who's most vulnerable? Research shows that certain groups need to be particularly mindful of VOC exposure: Young children, whose developing bodies are more sensitive to environmental toxins Elderly individuals with compromised immune systems People with existing respiratory conditions like asthma or allergies Those with chemical sensitivities Workers in industries with high VOC exposure, such as painting or manufacturing Understanding these risks is the first step toward making informed choices for a healthier home environment. In my journey toward creating a non-toxic home, I've learned that small, mindful changes in our product choices can significantly reduce VOC exposure and create a safer space for our families. When analysing European and UK residences, 65 individual VOCs were identified when analysing indoor air quality. 80% were associated with building and construction materials, 63% of these VOCs were linked with consumer products like hairsprays, deodorants, air fresheners etc.) and 19 of the 65 VOCs identified were associated with candle and incense burning. Unfortunately , activities we rarely think twice about can significantly impact our indoor air quality and drive the number of VOCs indoors: Morning routines (hairsprays, deodorants, and other personal care products) Household cleaning sessions Cooking and food preparation Using air fresheners or scented products In addition to these sources, VOCs are released from numerous other products and activities: Building Materials: Paints, solvents, varnishes, caulks, sealants, flooring materials, and pressed wood products are significant sources of VOCs Furniture including upholstery including upholstery, synthetic fabrics, conventional mattresses etc.\u00a0emit VOCs Personal care and household products including cosmetics like nail polishes, candles, air fresheners, cleaning products, disinfectants contribute to indoor VOC levels  Indoor air can be 2-5 times more polluted than outdoor air, largely due to VOCs. Research shows that conventional products can emit VOCs for months or even years. Making informed choices about the products we bring into our homes is our first line of defense. VOC removal is crucial for improving indoor air quality, and using carbon filters specifically designed for this purpose can be more effective than traditional air filters. Through extensive research, I\u2019ve compiled the most effective evidence-based strategies for reducing these invisible pollutants in our homes. Here\u2019s how to make better choices: Low-VOC products are widely available and contain significantly lower VOC concentrations than traditional paints, and sealants etc, and release fewer fumes, typically having fewer than 50 grams of VOCs per litre. To find these products, look for 'Low-VOC labels', and for building materials look for products with GreenGuard certification in products which indicates low VOC emissions. No-VOC products release virtually no VOCs, which are desirable to health-conscious consumers and people sensitive to chemical emissions. No-VOC products usually have fewer than 5 grams per litre. In building products like paint, GreenGuard and Green Seal certifications indicates compliance with stringent emission standards, and are a nothing to look for when trying to find a no-VOC product Scientific studies have shown that proper ventilation can reduce indoor VOC levels by up to 90%. This makes it one of our most powerful tools for improving indoor air quality. However, there are many ways you can improve your indoor air quality by reducing or removing VOCs: Open your windows and doors regularly, especially when painting, using cleaning products, and even cooking, and for a while afterwards to ensure the air is clear Use exhaust fans in your bathroom and kitchen, to capture and get rid of the lingering VOCs Use an air purifier with activated carbon filters - carbon filters are great to trap VOCs, and are perfect in areas of high VOC concentrations. Regularly changing the air filter is also crucial to maintain indoor air quality. Dehumidifiers can also be beneficial, as VOCs increase in high-humidity conditions, by reducing humidity, you can reduce your VOC levels According to NASA, air purifying plants are extremely good at absorbing VOCs and improving indoor air quality, a few examples: Peace Lily (removes benzene, formaldehyde) Chinese Evergreen (filters various VOCs) English Ivy (reduces airborne toxins by up to 60%) When possible, use a mask or fabric to cover your nose and mouth when using cleaning products, fragranced products and paints, to protect yourself from inhaling the fumes! Swapping out chemical-based cleaners with natural alternatives, or more natural products from the supermarket, can make a dramatic difference when it comes to your VOC exposure. Evidence-based DIY solutions: 1:1 water and white vinegar (proven 99% effective against common bacteria) Steam cleaning (eliminates 99.9% of germs without chemicals) If you are looking for a more convenient option I would opt for eco-friendly cleaning products like Ecover* (EcoCert certified, one of my personal favorites) Seventh Generation* (EPA Safer Choice certified) Did you know that you need to let new furniture sit in a well-ventilated area like a garage or a porch for a few days to allow VOCs to be removed naturally before bringing them into your living spaces? I didn't. This is a term called 'off-gassing' and it can last from a few days to several months dependent on the material. Understanding the science of off-gassing helps us make better decisions: Initial off-gassing period: unbox new furniture and furnishings outside when possible, as plastic packaging can trap VOCs, 3-7 days minimum in ventilated area VOC emissions typically peak in the first month Temperature and humidity affect emission rates Natural materials generally emit fewer VOCs  This one may sound obvious, but VOCs can cling to dust, so keeping a clean environment is important, especially in newly renovated areas. Tip: A damp mop can be helpful in removing those fine parts of dust you may have missed with a vacuum on a wooden floor. When renovating and purchasing new furniture opt for eco-friendly products and materials, investing in more sustainable products is worth it not only for your health, but often they end up lasting longer Select solid wood over composite materials (like MDF or particle board) as these products emit more VOCS, as more adhesives are used. Solid wood is a great choice for flooring, cabinets, tables etc. as it has lower VOC emissions, and is a better investment long term Favour sustainable materials over synthetic materials, choose natural fibre bedding, rugs etc, and upholstery and clothing from materials like wool, linen, hemp and cotton Go electric or induction stove tops over gas - Unlike gas stoves, electric and induction stove tops do not rely on combustion and do not emit VOCs. This is a huge advantage over gas stoves as they produce formaldehyde and benzene, which accumulate especially in poorly ventilated kitchens Opt for more natural and eco-friendly cosmetic products, there are plenty of non-toxic products available from scented candles and nail-polishes etc. that will not emit toxic VOCS into the atmosphere, why not give them a go! By reducing unnecessary items, you can limit VOC sources, a minimalist and non-toxic lifestyle naturally limits indoor pollutants Quality over quantity, opt for fewer high quality pieces over synthetic or inexpensive furnishings when possible Choose natural and more sustainable finishes - using natural oils like olive oil, beeswax, and low-VOC sealants, you can protect your wood surfaces instead of using synthetic varnishes which will over time tarnish your wood and release harmful pollutants into your indoor space Using airtight lids and containers for partially used products and for when not in use, can protect you from unnecessary VOC exposure Wherever possible, store VOC-emitting products in a location that is detached from your main living areas e.g. a shed, garage etc. this keeps VOCs away from your inside space Develop a ventilation routine - make a habit of regularly opening windows and running exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathroom, as fresh air dilutes indoor pollutants which helps reduce the buildup of VOCs over time If you are concerned about your indoor air quality, you can measure VOCs in real-time using an indoor air quality monitor (IAQ), this can help you track your air quality, and can indicate if more ventilation is required in your property Humidity control is another great option, as VOCs and other air pollutants thrive in high humidity, you should aim to keep your home in the range of between 40-60% to avoid this! VOCs are everywhere - we can admit VOCs are pretty hard to avoid as they are in so many of our everyday items, from paints to furnitures, and our personal care products, but we can reduce our exposure to harmful VOCs in our homes Choose low- and no-VOC alternatives when it comes to paints, cleaning supplies and building materials Boost your fresh air flow! - ventilation is the most important, regularly open your windows use exhaust fans, and maybe even invest in an air purifiers with carbon filters to remove VOCs and improve air quality Favor Natural and Durable Materials - reduce VOCs by selecting natural, solid wood furniture, eco-friendly fabrics over synthetic materials as these alternatives are more non-toxic and sustainable! Also remember to off gas new furnishings away from your main living space in a well ventilated area Store and Clean Smartly - keep VOC-releasing products in airtight containers away from main living areas and clean frequently to remove dust that can trap VOCs  The best way to eliminate VOCs from your home is by increasing ventilation through open windows and using exhaust fans. Additionally, you can reduce VOC sources by selecting low-VOC or no-VOC products, and regularly cleaning surfaces to remove VOCs that may have settled over time Some air purifiers, especially those equipped with activated carbon filters or photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) technology, can remove VOCs. However, traditional HEPA filters are not effective for VOC removal as they are designed to capture particulate matter rather than gases You can remove VOCs by improving ventilation (opening windows and using fans), using air purifiers with activated carbon or PCO filters, and reducing the use of products that emit VOCs. Regular cleaning of surfaces where VOCs may have settled also helps in reducing their levels Yes, VOCs can be removed through a combination of ventilation, using specialized air purifiers, and eliminating or reducing sources of VOC emissions such as paints, cleaning products, and furniture that off-gas Millie Chamberlain is a passionate medical writer based in London.

That's why wearing non-toxic sunscreen is essential to protect our skin from the sun's powerful rays and keep it looking and feeling healthy. The unfortunate thing is that the sunscreen products, just like with other daily beauty products we may be used to often contain harmful chemicals that are linked to causing cancer, hormone disruption, and skin irritation. Does this mean we can't enjoy a beautiful sunny day without exposing our skin to harmful chemicals? Not at all. Non toxic, effective, and natural sunscreens to the rescue! In this article, we'll look into the science behind non toxic sunscreen and why we should incorporate this healthier switch into our clean living journey. Let's get to it. Non toxic sunscreens are becoming increasingly popular as people begin to be more health-conscious and more mindful of the products they use on their skin. Non toxic sunscreens use natural ingredients such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide - both of which are active ingredients to protect the skin against the sun. These ingredients are also found in non toxic makeups and various cosmetic products. Unlike chemical sunscreens, natural alternatives don't have potentially harmful ingredients such as parabens, octinoxate, and oxybenzone. This type of sunscreen also comes in various forms, such as paste, stick, and lotion. If you're not into using these, there are also nontoxic spray sunscreens available.  These are the best non toxic sunscreens on the market that we've personally tested and loved.

Shop Solara here*  \u00a0 Health benefits and environmental impact make non toxic sunscreen distinct. Many other factors set non toxic sunscreen apart from conventional products. Mineral-Based Formulas Mineral-based formulas rely on active ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to create a protective layer on our skin that reflects sunlight away. This effect offers a broad spectrum of protection without the need for potentially harmful chemicals. Certifications and Labels Products that have labels like \"Reef Safe,\" \"Non-Nano,\" or \"EWG Verified\" mean they met the high standards for safety and environmental friendliness. Having these certifications provides peace of mind, ensuring the high quality of your sunscreens. Free from Harmful Chemicals Ingredients such as oxybenzone, octinoxate, and avobenzone are known for their harmful effects on the body and the environment. In non toxic sunscreens, you'll find natural, plant-based ingredients that protect the skin and promote non toxic living. Non Nano Zinc Oxide Many people prefer using sunscreens with non nano zinc oxide because they provide effective sun protection without penetrating the skin. The larger particles stay on the surface, reflecting and scattering UV rays. This reduces potential skin absorption and irritation, making it a safer choice, especially for sensitive skin.  While we all enjoy going out on a sunny day, being aware of the health effects of UV rays can lead us to worry about our skin health. These factors make it more difficult for us to choose the best sunscreen to use. Despite the effectiveness of sunscreen products against sunburns and skin cancer, not all sunscreens are created equal. This is where non toxic sunscreens come in - a healthier alternative that offers sun protection without the potential harm. Protecting Your Health: Traditional sunscreens often contain various toxic chemicals that can be absorbed through the skin and cause harm to the body. Switching to non toxic sunscreens leads to sun protection for your skin while also safeguarding your overall health. Gentle on Your Skin: One of the most common flaws of traditional sunscreens is skin irritation and stinging eyes after application caused by harmful ingredients. Non toxic sunscreens, on the other hand, are formulated with natural active ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which work best for sensitive skin. Eco-Friendly Choice: Chemical sunscreens are known for causing coral bleaching and marine ecosystem damage. Non toxic sunscreens protect and preserve our oceans and marine life. Safe for All Ages: It is challenging to find the safest sunscreen brands that are effective for our little ones, especially for those with sensitive skin. You can give kids mineral sunscreen products that provide a powerful solution suitable for all ages and skin types. For safe and effective sun protection, avoid sunscreen products that contain: Oxybenzone: A chemical filter that absorbs UV rays but can cause hormonal disruptions and allergic reactions. Octinoxate (endocrine disruptor): Another UV filter linked to endocrine disruption and potential reproductive toxicity. Homosalate: Used to absorb UVB rays, it can penetrate the skin and accumulate in the body, potentially disrupting hormones. Octocrylene: Stabilizes UV filters but can degrade into harmful byproducts and cause skin irritation. Parabens: Preservatives that prevent microbial growth but are known to mimic estrogen and disrupt hormonal balance. Retinyl Palmitate: A form of Vitamin A that may speed up the development of skin tumors and lesions when exposed to sunlight. PABA (Para-Aminobenzoic Acid): An older UV filter that can cause allergic reactions and skin sensitivities. Synthetic Fragrances: Added for scent, these can contain allergens and irritants, leading to skin reactions and potential long-term health effects.  Sunlight offers numerous health benefits, like vitamin D production and mood enhancement, but too much exposure can also pose risks. Let's explore the pros and cons to find a balanced perspective on sunlight's impact on our well-being. Vitamin D Production: Sunlight helps produce vitamin D, which is essential for bone health and a strong immune system. The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) influences at least 927 of our 20,000 genes, making it one of the most powerful hormone systems. It is crucial for intestinal absorption of calcium and magnesium, with 50% of magnesium and 80% of calcium absorption being VDR-dependent. Mood Enhancement: Exposure to sunlight boosts the production of serotonin, a hormone that enhances mood and promotes calmness. Higher serotonin levels are linked to a better mood and a greater sense of well-being, reducing the risk of depression and anxiety. Better Sleep Quality: Natural light helps regulate our circadian rhythm, the body's internal clock that controls our sleep-wake cycles. Getting sunlight during the day helps keep a healthy sleep pattern, leading to better sleep quality and overall improved health. Skin Aging: UV rays from the sun accelerate the breakdown of collagen and elastin in the skin, leading to wrinkles, sagging, and overall premature aging. Increased Risk of Skin Cancer: Getting too much sun exposure significantly increases the chances of developing different types of skin cancer, like melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. These cancers can be serious and even life-threatening, underscoring the importance of sun protection for skin health. Tips to get the good without the bad:\u00a0 Optimal Sun Exposure: Aim for sun exposure during early mornings or late afternoons when the UV index is below 3. Avoid Sunburn: Take precautions to prevent sunburn at all times. Protect During High UV Index: Wear a hat or use a UV umbrella* when the UV index is above 4. Vitamin D Supplements: Consider taking Vitamin D supplements*. Use Broad-Spectrum Sunscreen: Choose sunscreens with mineral formulas that protect against both UVA and UVB rays, such as EltaMD*. Opt for Mineral Sunscreens: Whenever possible, use mineral-based sunscreens. Avoid Burns: Remember, a sunburn can be more harmful than using chemical sunscreens, so aim to avoid both. Alternatives to Sunscreen: If you prefer not to use sunscreen, stick to seeking shade and wearing protective clothing. Non-toxic sunscreens typically use mineral ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide instead of synthetic chemicals for UV protection. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are non-toxic sunscreen ingredients commonly used for safe UV protection. Some other non toxic ingredients are jojoba oil, coconut oil, and almond oil. \"Chemical-free sunscreen\" is a misnomer, as all substances are made up of chemicals. However, mineral sunscreens use physical blockers like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide instead of synthetic chemical filters. Yes, mineral sunscreen, which uses ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, is a natural alternative to chemical sunscreen. \u00a0 *The links are so-called 'affiliate links.'

But what exactly are sustainable materials and what should you look out for? Don't worry, we've done the research for you and are here to present the most important points and criteria! Sustainable materials definitionSustainable materials are those that are produced in an environmentally, economically, and socially responsible manner. This means they are environmentally friendly, fair trade, and economically viable. The production of sustainable materials aims to protect natural resources and preserve the health of people and the environment. This is usually verified through various seals of approval that indicate a set of criteria that must be met. Some examples include the GOTS- oder das Fairtrade-Seal Sustainable materials should consist of natural fibers such as cotton, linen, or hemp. Organic and biological materials and fibers are produced without harmful pesticides and chemicals, making them better for the environment and your health. Look for certifications such as GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) or OEKO-TEX. One of the biggest problems we face is waste and what to do with all the plastic we\u2019ve already produced. Recycled materials are part of the solution, such as recycled polyester or recycled cotton can be great sustainable alternative. Recycled materials like recycled polyester or recycled nylon are made from already existing materials, therefore also putting less strain on the environment.  During production, eco-friendly processes should be used, such as the use of renewable energy or the avoidance of harmful chemicals in dyeing methods.  Another important criterion is fair working conditions. For example, the Fairtrade seal guarantees fair wages and humane working conditions for workers in production countries. The GOTS seal also includes social standards. Make sure the materials come from ethically and environmentally conscious companies. Materials from mass production can often have a negative impact on the environment. A sustainable material selection should also consider environmentally conscious production and socially responsible working conditions. Look for certifications such as Fairtrade or the Fair Wear Foundation. When you buy sustainable products, you're not only making the world a better place, but you're also investing in high-quality clothing with a longer lifespan and therefore investing in your future. The fashion industry is notorious for being one of the biggest contributors to environmental pollution worldwide. The production of clothing requires vast amounts of resources, including water, energy, and chemicals. And what's worse? Most of the clothes we wear are made from synthetic materials that aren't biodegradable and take hundreds of years to decompose. But the consequences of the fashion industry's reckless practices don't just affect the environment. They also have a direct impact on the people who make our clothes. Most textile workers earn paltry wages and toil away in abysmal working conditions. That's why sustainable materials matter. They help reduce the environmental impact of clothing production and fight against climate change. They also contribute to creating fairer working conditions for the people involved in their production. By purchasing sustainable clothing, you're supporting companies that prioritize eco-friendliness and fair labor practices. You're also doing your part to reduce the demand for unsustainable textiles and minimizing the fashion industry's impact on the planet. So, choose wisely and join the sustainable fashion revolution! \u00a0 The world is facing a climate crisis, and one of the most significant contributors to this crisis is the fashion industry. However, there is hope in the form of sustainable materials. By choosing environmentally-friendly materials, we can make a positive impact on the planet and promote a more sustainable future. Organic Cotton is one of the most well-known sustainable options. It is grown without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals, making it much more environmentally-friendly than traditional cotton. Organic cotton fabrics are also softer and more breathable than traditional cotton, making them ideal for clothing such as t-shirts and underwear. Hemp is one of the most sustainable raw materials in the world. It requires minimal water and can be grown without the use of pesticides. Hemp can be used to make a variety of materials, including clothing, paper, and building materials. Thease materials are made from fibers that are derived from raw materials such as wood, and are biodegradable. It requires minimal water and pesticides during processing and is soft and breathable. The fabrics are often used for clothing such as shirts and blouses or underwear. Foto von Alexander Schimmeck auf Unsplash Linen is a natural fiber derived from flax. It is biodegradable and requires less water and pesticides during production than cotton. Linen clothing is breathable, durable, and often used in summer fashion. Bamboo is a fast-growing plant that requires minimal water and pesticides, and is biodegradable. Bamboo fibers are soft and breathable, making them perfect for clothing such as t-shirts and underwear. Wool is a natural fiber derived from sheep. It is biodegradable and can often be recycled. Wool textiles are durable and provide excellent warmth, making them ideal for winter fashion. Cork is a renewable resource obtained from the bark of cork oak trees. Cork is lightweight, durable, and water-resistant. What's unique about this material is that it can completely regenerate itself. Cork is a very versatile material used for making shoes, handbags, and furniture, and is gaining popularity in the fashion industry with accessories like bracelets and earrings made from this sustainable material. A recent development in the field of natural materials is Pi\u00f1atex. This material is made from the fibers of pineapple leaves that would typically be discarded as waste. Pi\u00f1atex has similar properties to leather and is therefore widely used in the production of bags, shoes, and other accessories. Freshwater algae are a relatively new material and are still considered material innovations in the sustainable fashion industry. Still, freshwater algae Cladophora is already showing promise. This algae can be processed into a biodegradable material that looks and feels similar to silk. It's also a renewable resource that grows quickly and requires minimal water compared to traditional materials such as cotton. Although Cladophora is not yet widely used, it could play an important role in the production of sustainable textiles and other products in the future. The number of sustainable materials is constantly growing, offering an ever-increasing variety for environmentally-conscious consumers. Determining the most sustainable fiber can be a complex and multifaceted question. However, some fibers are generally considered to be more sustainable than others. For example, organic cotton, hemp, linen, and bamboo are often considered to be more sustainable than conventional cotton or synthetic fibers like polyester. However, even within these more sustainable options, there can be variations in sustainability depending on factors such as the farming practices used, the production processes, and the end-of-life options for the fiber. Nevertheless, Tencel, Modal, and Lyocell are three regenerated cellulose fibers that are often considered to be among the most sustainable. These fibers are all made from regenerated cellulose, which means that they are produced from natural materials such as wood pulp. While Lyocell currently has the smallest production volume, it is growing rapidly. The sustainability of these fibers can be evaluated based on factors such as the length of the fibers and the production process, including the source of the wood used and the use of water and pesticides. There are various certifications that indicate a product is sustainable, such as the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) or Cradle to Cradlecertification. Check the product label or website for these certifications. Sustainable materials should have a low environmental impact throughout their entire life cycle. Look for materials that are produced using renewable energy, have low greenhouse gas emissions, and minimize waste and water use. Pay attention to the proportion of organically produced fibers. Materials that consist of at least 95 percent organically produced fibers can be labeled as \"Organic\". If the proportion is at least 70 percent, the label \"Made with organic\" can be used. However, these materials may also contain conventional or chemical fibers. Some brands have a strong commitment to sustainability and use sustainable materials as a core part of their business. Do some research on the brand's website, social media, or through third-party sources to learn more about their sustainability practices \u00a0 Sustainable products are items or goods that have been produced taking into account social, ecological, and economic aspects and thus cause less harm to the environment. If you are looking for sustainable products, there are many ways to find environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional products. Here are some examples: Reusable produce bags* - with these, you can shop for fruits and vegetables without plastic packaging and reuse the bags again and again. Glass straws* - unlike single-use plastic straws, these straws are reusable and easy to clean. Washable makeup remover pads* - these pads are made from cotton or other sustainable materials and can be used again and again to clean your skin. Safety razor - a safety razor is an eco-friendly alternative to disposable razors since it lasts longer and has replaceable blades. Cotton bread bag - a cotton bread bag is an eco-friendly alternative to plastic bags or disposable paper bags for carrying bread or pastries. Bamboo toothbrush* - bamboo toothbrushes are a sustainable alternative to traditional plastic toothbrushes. Bamboo is biodegradable and therefore more environmentally friendly. Eco-friendly cleaning products: Cleaning products that are made from natural, non-toxic ingredients and are biodegradable. Upcycled products: Products made from waste materials that have been repurposed to create something new and useful. There are many other sustainable products on the market that can help you reduce your ecological footprint. But sustainability is not just about products - it's also about how long those products last to avoid unnecessary disposal. So whether you choose reusable products or long-lasting products, every sustainable product you buy can make a big difference for sustainability. Integrating sustainable materials into your wardrobe can be a great way to reduce your environmental impact. Here are some tips to help you do so: A first step is to become aware of what you already have in your closet. Taking inventory gives you an overview of what you own, which clothing items you no longer wear, and which pieces are your personal favorite\u00a0\u00a0apparel basics. This way, you can avoid buying unnecessary new clothes and thus conserve resources. Read our article about Capsule Wardrobe, to learn to create a timeless and sustainable wardrobe. Research sustainable materials: Look for clothing made from organic cotton, linen, hemp, bamboo, recycled polyester, or Tencel. These materials are often grown or produced using fewer resources and chemicals than conventional materials. Shop from sustainable brands: Many fashion brands are now committed to using sustainable materials and practices. Look for brands that prioritize ethical sourcing and production, use environmentally-friendly materials, and have transparent supply chains. Buy second-hand: Shopping for second-hand clothing is an excellent way to reduce your environmental impact. It reduces the demand for new clothing production and helps to extend the life of existing clothing. Invest in high-quality pieces: Opt for well-made, timeless pieces that will last for years. Quality pieces made from sustainable materials may be more expensive, but they will save you money in the long run and reduce waste. Take care of your clothing: Proper care of your clothing can extend its life and reduce the need for frequent replacements. Follow the care instructions on the label and mend any damages rather than discarding the item.

Many natural fiber clothing brands prioritize ethical sourcing and fair trade practices. By choosing natural fiber clothing, you\u2019re not only investing in your comfort, but also supporting sustainable and eco-friendly fashion. When selecting natural fiber clothing, it\u2019s important to consider quality indicators, labels and certifications, and ethical considerations to ensure you\u2019re making an informed and eco-conscious choice. Quality is a crucial factor in the textile and clothing industry. When it comes to natural fiber clothing, the perceived quality and the actual durability and functionality of the clothing play a significant role in the garment's lifespan. Extending the active lifetimes of garments by producing better quality is widely discussed as a strategy for reducing the environmental impacts of the garment industry. Understanding the quality of clothing is a multilayered process. Quality is considered throughout the life cycle of garments, from purchasing to using, taking care of, and ultimately discarding. Quality even plays a role after the first ownership, as it may allow multiple further owners or users if the quality permits. So how to consider quality indicators? Let us primarily focus on cotton and wool, as well as the environmental considerations linked to sustainability. Texture and Feel: To determine the quality of cotton, it's essential to feel the fabric. Good-quality cotton will have longer fibers that create a soft and smooth surface without loose furry fibers poking out. Weight and Opacity: Higher quality materials use more fibers, resulting in a heavier and thicker fabric. Sustainability Concerns: Organic or recycled cotton is preferred from an environmental standpoint, but recycled cotton should not be blended with polyester. Environmental Impact: Conventional cotton farming may lead to reduced biodiversity, high water consumption, and use of damaging chemical fertilizers and pesticides. It\u2019s also known to be highly water-intensive and accounts for a significant portion of the world\u2019s insecticide and pesticide use. Good to know: As of 2021, cotton represented about 30% of total textile fiber consumption, with major producing countries including India, China, and the United States. Texture and Feel: Quality wool garments should feel soft and not have short, fluffy fibers on the surface. Sustainability Considerations: Supporting brands that advocate for non-mulesed wool and farmers who carry out regenerative farming practices is recommended. Certifications such as New Zealand ZQ Merino can guide in identifying these considerations. Environmental Impact: Wool production has environmental impacts across the production process from sheep grazing through scouring, spinning, dyeing, and finishing. The environmental benefits and impacts can vary between farms, so traceability and certifications are vital. When choosing natural fiber clothing, look for labels and certifications that indicate the brand\u2019s commitment to sustainability and ethical practices. Some key certifications to look for include GOTS certification (global organic textile standard), which ensures the clothing is made from organic materials and meets high environmental standards; OEKO-TEX, which guarantees the clothing is free from harmful chemicals; or Fair Trade Certified, which ensures fair labor practices and safe working conditions for garment workers. By seeking out these certifications, you can trust that your natural fiber clothing has been produced with the utmost care for people and the planet. When investing in natural fiber clothing, be mindful of the environmental impact of the production process, the working conditions of the people who crafted the clothing, and the sustainability of the materials used. Choose brands that prioritize ethical practices, such as using organic and sustainable materials, ensuring fair labor practices and safe working conditions, and minimizing their environmental footprint. By considering these ethical factors and ensuring an ethical supply chain, you can feel confident that your natural fiber clothing not only looks and feels great, but also aligns with your values and supports a more sustainable future. Many clothing brands, including popular brands and niche artisan labels, have committed to ethical practices that prioritize sustainability, fair labor, and responsible manufacturing. Emphasizing natural and eco-conscious materials, such as cotton, hemp, and bamboo, as well as recycled materials, these brands demonstrate a commitment to both the environment and the ethical treatment of workers. Let's explore some of these practices in greater detail. Brands like Patagonia and Reformation are leading the charge as a sustainable clothing brand, creating clothes from natural fibers like GOTS certified organic cotton, hemp, and linen and prioritizing sustainability, fair labor, and ethical practices. In addition to well-known eco-friendly brands, there are also niche artisan producers who create unique, handcrafted natural fiber clothing. These producers often use traditional techniques and local materials to craft their garments, ensuring a one-of-a-kind product that reflects the skills and craftsmanship of the artisans. By supporting niche artisan producers, you\u2019re not only investing in beautiful, high-quality clothing, but also helping to preserve traditional crafts and promote sustainable fashion practices on a smaller scale. As the demand for sustainable and ethical fashion grows, many organic clothing brands, focusing on natural fibers, are emerging as leaders in the industry. Some of the top natural fiber clothing brands to watch in 2023 include Pact, People Tree, Amour Vert, Christy Dawn, Girlfriend Collective, Outland Denim, MATE the Label, Mara Hoffman, and many others These brands offer a range of sustainable and ethical clothing options, using natural fibers like organic cotton, hemp, and linen to craft their garments.

Fast fashion is identified as a significant contributor to environmental damage due to its cheap production, short lifespan, and synthetic materials. Be warned about greenwashing, where brands create illusions of sustainability without transparency When shopping for natural fiber clothing, it\u2019s essential to know how to identify and choose the best options for your needs. Be on the lookout for organic and untreated options, such as pesticide free organic cotton, and take a closer look at the source of the fabric, considering where and how the cotton was grown. Look for certifications or labels that signify the use of natural fibers, such as GOTS, Fair Trade, and B Corporation, to ensure you\u2019re investing in quality materials. Washing and maintaining clothing made from natural fibers, necessitates special attention to preserve both their appearance and quality. Here's an in-depth guide to ensure longevity: To maintain the appearance and quality of your natural fiber clothing, it\u2019s important to follow the proper washing and maintenance guidelines.

Caring for clothes made from natural fibers requires a gentle touch: Washing: Detergent: Use mild, eco-friendly detergents specifically designed for natural fibers. Plant-based detergents are perfect for maintaining the integrity of natural fabric clothing. Water Temperature: Try to often wash in cold water, as hot water can cause shrinkage or damage to the fibers. Method: Hand wash or use a gentle machine wash cycle to protect the fibers. Drying: Lay flat or air-dry your garments to prevent any alteration to the shape or integrity of the fiber. Avoid tumble drying, as it may cause unnecessary wear and tear. Avoiding Common Mistakes: Steer clear of fabric softeners and bleach, which can weaken the fibers and cause discoloration. Hot water should be avoided, as it can lead to fading or other alterations to the garment's appearance. Using eco-friendly cleaning products is an excellent way to minimize the environmental impact of caring for your natural fiber clothing. Look for cleaning products that are free of harsh chemicals, such as phosphates, chlorine, and formaldehyde, as they can harm the environment and your clothing. Additionally, consider using reusable cleaning cloths made from natural fibers, such as cotton or bamboo, to further reduce waste and environmental impact. By using environmentally friendly cleaning products and practices, you can maintain your natural fiber clothing and support a sustainable non toxic lifestyle. \u00a0 If you enjoyed this post, check out these other articles on safe and non toxic products: Best Non-Toxic Activewear Brands for a Healthier Workout Natural fibres, like cotton, are soft and breathable, which makes them perfect for those with delicate skin. They are also strong and will keep you cool, dry and comfortable. Natural fibers are plant or animal-based fibres that are used to create fabric. Common examples of natural fibers include cotton, silk, linen, wool, hemp, rayon, modal, lyocell, alpaca fleece, camel hair and spider silk. These fibers are more sustainable and ethical than synthetic fabrics. Wearing natural fibers like cotton, linen, or wool offers advantages in comfort, breathability, and sustainability. They often feel softer against the skin and provide excellent temperature regulation. However, personal preference and specific garment needs may influence the choice between natural and synthetic materials. Cotton is the cheapest and most widely used fiber for garments, as it has been used for thousands of years due to its numerous advantages. It is strong, durable, and comfortable, and it is also easy to dye and print on. Cotton is also breathable, which makes it a great choice for summer clothing. Additionally, it is relatively easy to care for. Natural fibers are a much more sustainable option than synthetic fibers due to their biodegradability, lower energy and water requirements, and reduced environmental impact. Synthetic fibers, on the other hand, are made from petroleum-based products and are not biodegradable. They require more energy and water to produce, and their production process releases more pollutants into the environment.

Learn more \u2192 There seem to be endless ways that we are unaware of the horrific impact that the things we buy, use, and consume have on our health and environment. From PFAS in clothing, cosmetics to our cookware to sulfates in popular shampoos, these truths have been a wake-up call for many. But one particularly startling revelation is discovering that nearly 95% of the average wardrobe is made of the same thing as disposable water bottles. A closer look at the tags on the garments in most closets reveals a common denominator.\u00a0 Polyester. Polyester. POLYESTER. Wait a second... Is polyester plastic?? This can't be good. So much of the world's wardrobe is made up of polyester fabrics - 52%, to be exact! And so much of it ends up in the landfill. When you consider the global crisis of plastic pollution and the fact that this material poses health risks to some who wear it, it becomes painfully clear that polyester clothing is a major problem. Are the clothes in your closet turning you and your family into walking, talking pieces of plastic? In this article, we'll navigate these (microplastic-filled) waters to discover what exactly polyester is, the implications of these synthetic fibers, and explore better alternatives while we're at it! At this point, maybe you've checked the tags in your own wardrobe and saw \"polyester\" aplenty. But what is polyester really? When we talk about polyester, we're delving into the world of synthetic polymers. In simpler terms, it's a type of plastic specifically derived from a category of polymers known as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Yes, the same material used in making those ubiquitous plastic bottles! Image: Jonathan Chng (Unsplash) Here's a little breakdown... The production of polyester is a journey through a maze of chemical reactions, each step leaving its mark on the planet. From the extraction of crude oil to the final textile product, the process is fraught with environmental hazards. Let's take a deeper look. The journey of polyester from a petroleum derivative to a wardrobe mainstay is a complex one. To understand the full scope of its impact, let's look at the process in two phases: the production process and its ongoing impact on the world. Image: Ben Wicks (Unsplash) The story of polyester starts with crude oil extraction. This process is not only energy-intensive but also leads to the depletion of a non-renewable resource. The extraction and refining of crude oil release harmful pollutants into the air and water, contributing to global warming and ecological damage. Transforming petroleum into polyester involves a series of chemical reactions. The primary components, ethylene glycol, and terephthalic acid, are derived from petroleum and combined in a polymerization process to create polyethylene terephthalate (PET). This process is energy-hungry, contributing to the high carbon footprint of polyester. The energy used is often sourced from fossil fuels, further exacerbating the issue of greenhouse gas emissions.  After the creation of PET, the next step is taking the raw material and turning it into fibers and then into fabric - a critical stage with it\u2019s own environmental implications. Dyeing and Finishing Post-production polyester fabrics are often treated with various chemicals to enhance color, texture, and durability. The dyes used for polyester, known as disperse dyes, are particularly concerning due to their non-biodegradability and potential toxicity.These chemicals can leach into waterways during the dyeing process and from the finished products during washing, posing risks to aquatic life and contaminating water sources. Image: Dan Gold (Unsplash) One of polyester's most admired qualities becomes its biggest environmental drawback post-consumption. Polyester fibers are resistant to biodegradation, meaning they can linger in landfills for hundreds of years. As the fast fashion industry continues to churn out inexpensive polyester garments, the volume of textile waste in landfills grows exponentially. This non-biodegradable waste not only occupies vast amounts of landfill space but also contributes to the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as it slowly degrades. Perhaps the most insidious impact of polyester is its contribution to microplastic pollution. Every wash of polyester clothing releases thousands of tiny synthetic fibers. These microfibers, too small to be caught by wastewater treatment plants, make their way into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Once in the water, they are ingested by marine life, leading to physical and chemical harm. The accumulation of these microplastics in the marine environment is a growing concern, with studies indicating their presence in the deepest ocean trenches and most remote arctic ice. The implications for marine ecosystems are severe, and the potential for these microplastics to enter the human food chain through seafood consumption is a worrying prospect.   You may have caught wind of the conversation that has been gaining some traction around recycled polyester as a sustainable solution to the issues of polyester fabric. Recycled polyester, made from post-consumer plastic like water bottles, is often touted as a more sustainable option, but as we've seen, there are many aspects to the challenges we face with polyester, and we need a holistic approach. While recycled polyester helps solve one facet of the situation, it doesn't address them all. Recycled materials like recycled plastic bottles are saved from ending up in landfills when they are made into new polyester fibers; however, this process is not without its own environmental costs: Recycled polyester offers some environmental benefits, but it's not a complete solution. A more comprehensive approach of focusing on reducing consumption, improving recycling technologies, and exploring alternative materials, is crucial for a truly sustainable future in fashion.  While the environmental issues of polyester are well-documented, its impact on health is an area of growing concern. Polyester's synthetic nature means it lacks the breathability of natural fibers, potentially leading to skin irritation and discomfort. This is particularly concerning for those with sensitive skin or allergies, as the fabric can trigger reactions such as textile dermatitis. The chemicals used in the manufacturing process of polyester, including dyes and finish resins, can also pose health risks to the consumer. While safety regulations are in place, the long-term effects of exposure to these chemicals are not fully understood. This raises questions about the safety of polyester, especially in children's clothing, where skin sensitivity and health are paramount. Its rise to fame can be attributed to: These qualities make it ideal for a wide range of garments, from casual wear to high-performance athletic apparel. However, this convenience masks a darker truth and inspires the question: Is there a better alternative? Image: Seven Seven (Unsplash) In light of these concerns, shifting towards sustainable fashion choices and a\u00a0\u00a0healthier non toxic lifestyle becomes imperative. This shift involves embracing materials that are kinder to both the planet and our health. Natural fibers such as wool, linen, and cotton are excellent alternatives. And when it comes to our little ones, choosing organic kids' clothes is a great idea. Organic cotton, for example, is grown without harmful pesticides and processed without toxic chemicals, making it a safer and more sustainable option. Choosing sustainable materials is not just about reducing environmental impact; it's about making a conscious decision for our health and the well-being of future generations. By opting for organic and natural fibers, we can reduce our reliance on synthetic materials like polyester fabric. Image\u00a0@ Ricarda Sch\u00fcller In exploring the question, \"Is polyester plastic?\" we've unraveled some uncomfortable truths. From its petroleum-based origins to its contribution to microplastic pollution and potential health risks, the impact of polyester extends far beyond our closets. It's clear that our relationship with this ubiquitous fabric needs a thoughtful reevaluation for a sustainable future. As we navigate towards more eco-conscious choices, our decisions about our wardrobes are crucial. For adults and children alike, opting for organic cotton clothing offers a safer, more environmentally friendly alternative. So, next time you're shopping for new clothes, consider the impact of your choices. Explore the Orbasics collection of adults' and kids' organic cotton clothes for options that are kind to the Earth and gentle on your skin. Together, we can make a difference, one garment at a time.

And that's where sustainability certifications come in handy. We\u2019re often flooded with labels like \u201ceco-friendly,\u201d \u201cbiodegradable,\u201d \u201cnatural,\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d everywhere we go, but how reliable are these claims? Unfortunately, many turn out to be misleading. When we're just learning how to be more sustainable, opting for products with green claims and leafy imagery makes us feel good about our choices. However, not all companies live up to their promises. That's why it's so important to support brands that truly back their claims with real efforts. The good news is that sustainability certifications are our best allies to verify a company's claims. When I began my sustainability journey, I was overwhelmed by how many certifications and standards there are. But luckily for you, I'm here to help. After conducting thorough research, I\u2019ve compiled a list of the 20 best sustainability certifications to look for. Let's explore which ones you can trust! Sustainability certifications and standards are third-party verifications given to a company, organization, or product to back up its commitment to social or environmental aspects, including, but not limited to, good environmental practices, ethical sourcing, animal welfare, chemical safety, and energy efficiency. These are voluntary certification schemes that companies choose to opt for, adhering to specific guidelines in order to get certified by an accredited certifying body. When you find a sustainable brand with a sustainability certification, you can trust its green claims and practices have been verified. After all, sustainably certified companies go through a certification process that involves meeting strict requirements and ongoing commitment. Let's take a closer look at these key steps that companies must complete to obtain a sustainability certification! The reason I fully trust sustainable certifications is that I know certified companies are held to high standards of accountability and transparency, demonstrating their genuine commitment to sustainability. In general, most sustainably certified companies must: Adhere to strict standards: Sustainably certified companies must adhere to stringent rules, including specific guidelines for the use of toxic chemicals in clothes, requirements for fair labor practices, waste management strategies, supply chain transparency, and more. Undergo rigorous assessments: To get certified, companies must undergo regular audits and provide detailed documentation of their sustainability practices and environmental performance to verify compliance with the certification\u2019s requirements. Engage in ongoing monitoring: Actions speak louder than words, which is why most certification bodies require sustainably certified companies to commit to continuous improvement and undergo regular inspections to ensure compliance with the certification scheme over time. Thanks to these verification steps, sustainability certifications help us identify ethical companies with a true commitment to environmental sustainability and social responsibility. But the real benefits of sustainability certifications go beyond this. Let\u2019s explore how sustainability certifications help us take care of the environment, our health, and others!  A sustainability certification can have many benefits not just for you as a consumer, but also for the well-being of our planet, local communities, animals, and workers: Environmental Impact: Sustainability certifications guarantee that companies are working towards minimizing environmental impact, conserving natural resources, preserving biodiversity, preventing pollution, and much more. When we choose sustainable products, we are promoting environmentally friendly practices. Health & Safety: Choosing certified organic or non-toxic products can be a healthier option for you as well. These certifications tend to limit or prohibit harmful substances to prioritize consumer safety and help you choose healthier products.  Animal Well-being: Many certifications focus specifically on animal protection. If you're an animal lover, you can look for certified cruelty-free or vegan products that align with your values, as well as those that ensure the ethical treatment of animals in the textile industry. Ethical Practices: You can also find ethical and fair trade certifications that guarantee workers' safety, promote good working conditions, prohibit child labor, and ensure fair wages throughout the supply chain. Now that we understand what sustainability certifications are, the certification process, and their benefits, let's delve into the most common (and reliable) sustainable certifications you'll encounter! Sustainability professionals estimate that there are more than 400 voluntary sustainability standards worldwide. If there\u2019s one thing I can guarantee, it\u2019s that trying to learn and remember all of these certifications can definitely be overwhelming. And frankly, no company can achieve to be certified by all of them. A much better idea is to focus on the most trustworthy and widely recognized product certifications, which we've described below. And just to be clear: sustainability is a broad term and most certifications focus on different aspects of it. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve organized them into different types.  First of all, we'll address some general certifications or programs. These certifications usually focus on more than one aspect of the company's sustainability practices:  What It Certifies: Sustainable companies (not products) Why It Matters: Certifies companies that balance purpose and profit If you've been comparing sustainable brands, chances are you've encountered a few certified B Corps by now. The B Corp certification is one of the most prestigious \u2014not to mention difficult\u2014 certifications to obtain in the sustainability space. Think of this sustainability certification as the cherry on top for a brand. To get certified, a company must meet high standards for social and environmental performance. If you'd like to discover what makes B Corps different from traditional businesses, make sure to check out our Complete Guide to B Corps.  What It Certifies: Apparel, building materials, furniture, personal care items, and cleaning supplies Why It Matters: Certifies products that are safe, circular, and responsibly made While not as popular as the B Corp certification, the Cradle to Cradle certification is another widely recognized sustainability certification framework that demonstrates a product's sustainability and environmental responsibility. This sustainability certification assesses products across five categories: material health, product circularity, clean air and climate protection, water and soil stewardship, and social fairness. Simply put, this certification awards products that prioritize human health, support the circular economy, prevent climate change, protect ecosystems, and promote fair business practices. Multiple certifications demonstrate a brand's commitment to supporting environmental and social causes. Today, we'll talk about one you've probably seen on various websites:  What It Certifies: Brands (not products) Why It Matters: Certifies companies that contribute to environmental charities 1% for the Planet is a sustainability certification that is given to companies that donate at least 1% of their gross sales to approved environmental charities. When you see the 1% for the Planet certification logo on a brand's website or product, you can rest assured that a fraction of your money will go to meaningful causes addressing common environmental issues. It's important to note that this sustainability certification only certifies the company\u2019s philanthropic efforts, which does not necessarily mean that a company or its products are eco-friendly.  The well-being of animals is one of my top priorities when looking for sustainable products. If you want to protect our adorable, furry friends as well, opt for products with these trustworthy certifications:  What It Certifies: Personal care, cosmetic, and cleaning brands (not individual products) Why It Matters: Certifies that a company does not take part in animal testing The Leaping Bunny certification is the most stringent and trusted standard for cruelty-free products. What I love about this sustainability certification is that it ensures companies do not engage in animal testing at any stage of production. This means a certified company's final products, formulations, and ingredients are not tested on animals. Similarly, a certified company can't request others to conduct tests on their behalf or sell their products in countries where animal testing is required by law. Keep in mind that this certification doesn't certify that a brand is vegan.  What It Certifies: Foods, drinks, mattresses, personal care, clothing, and household products Why It Matters: Certifies products that are vegan and have not been tested on animals If you prefer products that are free from both animal testing and animal ingredients, this sustainability certification will help you recognize vegan and cruelty-free products. Certified Vegan by Vegan Action guarantees that products are 100% free of animal-derived ingredients or components, even when it comes to cross contamination. In other words, if a vegan product is produced in the same machinery as non-vegan products, companies must demonstrate that the surface is thoroughly cleaned in between batches. Similarly, certified products must not have animal testing involved at any stage of production either.  What It Certifies: Wool yarn, apparel made from wool Why It Matters: Certifies that sheep are treated humanely Wool is by far my favorite natural fiber for winter clothing, but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing something that compromised an innocent animal's well-being. That's why I always seek sustainable brands that are certified by the Responsible Wool Standard. This sustainability certification guarantees that the wool comes from farms that treat animals with respect, have good environmental management practices, and adhere to the Five Freedoms of animal welfare. One of the problems with the fashion industry is that many brands are creating 'trendy' clothing while destroying our ecosystems along the way. And to make things worse, the final garments are often filled with toxic chemicals that mess up our hormones. Luckily, you can prevent all this by supporting the slow fashion movement, preferring sustainable materials, and looking for these trustworthy certifications:  What It Certifies: Textiles and fabrics Why It Matters: Certifies that a product is free from over 100 harmful substances The OEKO-TEX Standard 100 is one of my favorite certifications to spot chemical-free clothing. When a clothing item carries the OEKO-TEX Standard 100, it means that it's free from harmful substances that could affect human health or the environment. What makes this sustainability certification truly shine is that every component of a certified textile article \u2014including zippers, threads, and buttons\u2014 must be tested for harmful substances to guarantee the article is completely harmless to human health. However, this certification framework is focused solely on the finished products, not the raw materials.  What It Certifies: Clothing, home textiles, mattresses, fabrics, personal care products Why It Matters: Certifies products that contain 70% or more organic materials While natural fibers are more popular than polyester among conscious consumers, they also come with an environmental cost. And that's something we can prevent with GOTS certified clothing. This stringent sustainability certification serves as a straightforward guide to identifying truly organic products, as only those with over 70% organic materials can get certified. The GOTS certification monitors a product's entire supply chain, including processing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, trading, and distribution. Similarly, certified products must adhere to strict guidelines regarding chemical use, raw materials, waste management, contamination risks, and more. If you're thinking this certification scheme only applies to organic cotton, you'll be glad to hear it also covers other natural fibers like hemp, linen, and jute!  What It Certifies: Clothes, textiles Why It Matters: Certifies products that are safe for the environment, workers, and customers Another popular sustainability certification in the textile industry is the Bluesign label. This sustainability certification is awarded to products that meet strict safety and environmental standards throughout their supply chain, from raw materials to finished products. Unlike other certification schemes, the Bluesign\u00ae SYSTEM guarantees the safety of a product by removing harmful substances before they enter the supply chain. We all deserve to enjoy a decent quality of life. Unfortunately, this is not the reality for many vulnerable workers around the globe. Let's explore some certifications to promote and guarantee equitable trade: What It Certifies: Clothing, textiles, food, tea, coffee Why It Matters: The certification ensures fairer terms of trade between farmers and buyers When it comes to food and beverages, I prefer products carrying the Fairtrade International mark. Not only does this certification ban child labor and protect workers' rights, it also promotes transparency and provides a framework for small producers to build thriving farms. The Fairtrade International certification also addresses other environmental criteria, such as responsible water management and minimal use of pesticides.  What It Certifies: Clothing, food, beverages Why It Matters: Promotes safe working conditions and fair economic practices Fair Trade Certified is another sustainability certification that helps us identify ethically-made products. Fair trade USA, the certifying body of the label, requires certified businesses to ensure safe working conditions, guarantee fair compensation, and protect the environment. This third party verification also includes guidelines to protect waterways, reduce waste, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce the use of toxic chemicals. One of the first things I do before purchasing a new product is to check how safe it is, especially with everyday products. If we aim to have a healthy lifestyle, long-term exposure to harmful substances can diminish our efforts. So, let's check some of the most trustworthy certifications for non-toxic products:  What It Certifies: Apparel, bedding, personal care, childcare items Why It Matters: Certifies a product is free from over 6,500 harmful substances As someone who cares about the safety of my products, I can't recommend the Made Safe seal enough. This rigorous third party verification guarantees a certified product is free from over 6,500 known or probable carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, toxins, hazardous flame retardants, high-risk pesticides, toxic solvents, and harmful VOCs.  What It Certifies: Skincare, personal care, hair care, cleaning products Why It Matters: Certifies products that meet the organization\u2019s strict standards for health When it comes to personal care products, I put my full trust in the EWG Verified mark. You might know The Environmental Working Group for its Skin Deep database, a guide to safer personal care products. But this non-profit also certifies products that are free from any ingredients on EWG's \"Unacceptable\" list, which includes ingredients with health, ecotoxicity, and/or contamination concerns.  What It Certifies: Cleaning, household, and personal care products Why It Matters: Certifies products that are safer for human health and the environment What I love about the EPA Safer Choice label is that it goes above and beyond to certify products that are made with safe ingredients without compromising on performance. When you find a product with this sustainability certification, you can feel confident it's safe for you, your family, pets, and the environment. If you're on the hunt for new home appliances, look for products with this sustainability certification:  What It Certifies: Home appliances, electronics, lighting, heating and cooling Why It Matters: Certifies products that use less energy than conventional options The Energy Star label is given to products that meet strict energy efficiency criteria set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. This sustainability certification helps us identify home appliances and electronics that match or exceed the quality of conventional options while using less energy! If you work in construction or want to promote healthier cities, it's worth learning about this certification: What It Certifies: Green buildings, communities, healthy cities Why It Matters: Evaluates the environmental performance of a building The LEED certification is run by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), the certifying body. This sustainability certification is a rating system that assigns different levels to certified green buildings: platinum, gold, silver, and certified LEED. The certification measures the environmental performance of new and existing buildings based on criteria such as materials, emissions, renewable energy, and more. Deforestation is one of the most alarming environmental issues around the world. Globally, around 10 million hectares of forest are lost every year. An easy way to make sure our purchases aren't promoting mass deforestation is to look for the following sustainability certifications:  What It Certifies: Forestry products such as paper and wood products\u00a0 Why It Matters: The certification promotes more sustainable forest management practices You've probably seen the FSC logo on sustainable brands' paper and cardboard packaging. That's because the Forest Stewardship Council\u2019s certification guarantees a product's forest-based materials come from responsibly managed forests. The Forest Stewardship Council also focuses on the restoration of forests, the protection of indigenous rights and endangered species, the promotion of workers' well-being, and the restriction of hazardous pesticides.  What It Certifies: Agricultural products, forestry products, tourism businesses Why It Matters: Promotes environmental responsibility, social equity, and economic viability Have you ever encountered this cute little frog on a product's packaging? In case you didn't know, the Rainforest Alliance label guarantees the sustainable sourcing of raw materials. In fact, certified products must contain at least 90% of ingredients sourced from responsibly managed forests or farms. Additionally, the Rainforest Alliance certification seeks to improve farmers' lives and help them adapt to climate change while protecting their forests and supporting local communities.  What It Certifies: Palm oil used in food and personal care products Why It Matters: Certifies that palm oil is produced sustainably The production of palm oil is often linked to large-scale deforestation and biodiversity loss. To prevent this, we can seek brands using sustainably sourced palm oil that's certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. The RSPO monitors all parts of the supply chain, ensuring the production of palm oil didn't cause deforestation or affect local communities. Let's check a fantastic certification to identify companies reducing their contribution to climate change:  What It Certifies: Brands in personal care, cleaning, apparel, technology, and more Why It Matters: Ensures that certified companies take responsibility for their carbon emissions The Climate Neutral label certifies companies that have measured, reduced, and offset the carbon emissions from all their activities throughout the entire supply chain, from sourcing materials to the moment the product reaches your hands. Sustainably certified brands are committed to reducing their environmental impact by minimizing their emissions and removing carbon from the atmosphere. These trustworthy sustainability certifications will help you understand a brand's commitment to sustainability and trust their green claims. But let's not forget that achieving a zero waste certification or certification of sustainability is not always possible for small businesses, especially due to the elevated costs of third party verifications and the advanced knowledge required to go through the certification process. If you're interested in a sustainable brand that doesn't hold any sustainability certifications, take some time to learn more about the brand and consider other factors, such as its values, practices, materials, and packaging, to make an informed decision!  Yes, there are many certifications for sustainability! These range from broad certifications like B Corp, which evaluates a company's entire social and environmental impact, to more specific ones like GOTS for organic textiles or Energy Star for energy-efficient appliances. The right certification depends on the product or company you're looking at. While ISO 9001 is a valuable quality management certification, it doesn't directly address sustainability. ISO 9001 focuses on ensuring consistent quality in products and services. However, some of its principles, like continual improvement and evidence-based decision making, can indirectly support sustainability efforts. For direct sustainability management, look to certifications like ISO 14001 or B Corp instead. Yes, ISO 14001 is directly related to sustainability. It's an international standard for Environmental Management System (EMS). Companies with ISO 14001 certification have committed to minimizing their environmental impact, complying with applicable laws, and continually improving their environmental performance. While it doesn't guarantee a product is \"green,\" it does show that a company is actively working to become more sustainable. The world of sustainability certifications is vast and growing! According to the International Trade Centre's Standards Map, there are over 300 sustainability standards across different sectors and issues. However, if we include regional and industry-specific standards, the number could be well over 400. This abundance of standards can feel overwhelming, which is why we've focused on 20 of the most reputable and widely recognized certifications in this article. Remember, it's not about finding a product with every possible certification. Instead, look for certifications that align with your values and the specific sustainability aspects you care about most.

From the time soap was invented, people have used it for cleanliness. But over the years, soap manufacturers started adding harmful chemicals like phthalates and triclosan, compromising our health for the sake of \"hygiene.\" Luckily, there are brands that offer natural soaps using natural organic ingredients for those of us who want to maintain non-toxic living while staying clean. In this article, we'll explore the organic soaps that keep us fresh and why switching to these chemical free soap alternatives can make a big difference in our health. Imagine washing your face with something that might secretly be harming your skin and health. That's the reality with many conventional soaps. They're often packed with troublemakers like phthalates and triclosan - ingredients that can throw your hormones off balance and potentially lead to more serious health issues down the road. Did you know that a recent study found 37% of commercial soaps were actually toxic to the main cells in our skin's outer layer? The very products meant to clean our skin can damage its protective barrier, leading to dryness and irritation. But here's the good news: switching to non-toxic, organic body soap can be a game-changer for your skin and overall well-being. Here's why we're head over heels for these natural alternatives: Happy, Healthy Skin: Free from harsh chemicals, organic body soap treats your skin with kid gloves, reducing irritation and leaving it softer than ever. Earth-Friendly Clean: These soaps are often biodegradable, letting you pamper yourself without hurting the planet. Hormonal Harmony: By ditching synthetic additives, organic body soap help keep your body's natural rhythms in tune. Nutrient Boost: Packed with natural oils and plant goodness, these soaps nourish your skin with vitamins and antioxidants. Ready to make the switch? We've scoured the clean beauty world to find the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of natural soaps: these nontoxic and organic soap gems have earned a special place in our bathroom Dr. Bronner's Pure-Castile | Shop here* Chagrin Valley | Shop here* Dr. Bronner's Castile Baby | Shop here* Moon Valley | Shop here* Earth Mama | Shop here* 100% Pure | Shop here* Canary | Shop here* Aspen Kay Naturals | Shop here* Bee the Light | Shop here* Crate 61 | Shop here* Sweet Harvest Farms | Shop here* Meliora | Shop here* Fontana | Shop here*  Water and soap are our best friends, helping us stay clean and fresh. But not all soaps are created equal, which is why we've become a bit obsessed with finding the best ones for you and your family. We've divided our favorites into two groups: the \"Best\" (our absolute top picks) and the \"Better\" (still fantastic, but with a slight twist)\"\u2014based on their ingredients and overall safety. \"Best\" products are our top picks for organic soaps on the market. Packed with the safest and most effective natural ingredients, they ensure minimal exposure to harmful chemicals. These soaps are made with premium organic ingredients and often have some of the most respected non-toxic certifications, such as Made Safe and EWG. \"Better\" Don't let the name fool you - these soaps are still amazing! These natural soaps are still excellent non-toxic options but might not fully meet the criteria for the \"Best\" category. They either do not claim to be organic but have notable non-toxic certifications or claim to be organic but lack formal certifications, often because they are produced by small-scale soap makers in small batches.

Shop Fontana here*\u00a0  Image @ Fontana These were our picks for the best natural soaps. Each one offers a unique blend of nourishing nontoxic ingredients and eco-friendly practices that align perfectly with a healthier, more mindful lifestyle. While natural soaps provide a wonderful array of benefits through their nourishing, non-toxic ingredients and eco-friendly practices, it's important to understand the limitations of labeling soaps as \"organic.\" No soap can truly be organic because they all contain caustic substances like sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, which are inorganic compounds. The FDA requires that over 95% of a product's ingredients must be organic to be labeled as organic. This applies to self-care products like lotions, deodorants, and shampoos. However, no soap can meet this standard because 20% of its composition must be either sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. When a soap is certified organic, it means that some or all of the other ingredients, except for the sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, are organic. These other components meet strict organic standards, ensuring the soap's ingredients are free from synthetic chemicals and pesticides. Natural soaps are made from plant and mineral ingredients without synthetic additives or chemicals. They usually contain natural oils, butter, and essential oils, creating a gentle, environmentally friendly product. What soap has the least amount of chemicals? The soap with the least amount of chemicals is organic soap, made mainly from plant-based ingredients and natural oils. These soaps avoid synthetic additives, focusing on organic and environmentally friendly components. When it comes to soap, \"organic\" is a pledge to better skin health and a cleaner planet. Picking organic soaps over conventional ones benefits ourselves and the environment. Keep these in mind when checking ingredient labels and make sure they aren't listed! Parabens Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) Phthalates Triclosan Formaldehyde Polyethylene Glycol (PEGs) Choosing organic soaps means understanding the ingredients and brand commitments to ensure you get a safe, high-quality product. Check the Ingredients List Organic Oils and Butters: Look for natural oils like coconut, olive, and shea butter. These ingredients nourish and moisturize your skin. Avoid Harmful Chemicals: Steer clear of parabens, sulfates (SLS), phthalates, triclosan, and synthetic fragrance. These can cause skin irritation and other health issues. Consider Your Skin Type and Needs Sensitive Skin: Choose soaps with gentle, soothing ingredients like calendula, chamomile, and aloe vera. Dry Skin: Opt for soaps with high moisturizing content like shea butter, avocado butter, and coconut oil. Oily or Acne-Prone Skin: Look for soaps with tea tree oil, charcoal, or sea buckthorn oil to help balance and cleanse the skin and remove dead skin cells. Assess Brand Commitments Sustainability: Check if the brand uses biodegradable ingredients and eco-friendly packaging. Brands committed to reducing plastic waste and supporting environmental initiatives are preferable. Community Support: Brands that give back to the community or support charitable causes align with ethical consumer values. Understand the \"Organic\" Conundrum Soap Composition: No soap can be entirely organic due to the presence of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. However, soaps can still be labeled organic if their other ingredients meet organic standards. Natural vs. Organic: Natural soaps are made without synthetic additives but may not be fully organic. Organic soaps are made with ingredients grown without pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. Read Reviews and Testimonies Customer Feedback: Look for reviews from users with similar skin types and concerns. Positive experiences and consistent quality are good indicators of a reliable product. Try Samples: Some brands offer sample packs. Trying liquid or bar soap can help you find the best match for your skin. Certifications are crucial for ensuring that your organic body soap meets high standards of safety, sustainability, and ethical practices. Here are some key clean beauty certifications to look for: USDA Organic: Indicates that the soap\u2019s ingredients are mostly organic and free from synthetic chemicals and pesticides. Leaping Bunny: Confirms that the product is cruelty-free and not tested on animals. Made Safe: Ensures that the product is free from harmful chemicals and safe for human use. Fair Trade: Guarantees that ingredients are sourced ethically, providing fair wages and working conditions for farmers and workers. EWG Verified: Indicates that the product meets the Environmental Working Group\u2019s strict standards for health and transparency. NSF/ANSI 305: Certifies that the product contains at least 70% organic ingredients and meets specific safety and quality standards. All soaps contain inorganic compounds like sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, therefore cannot legally meet the FDA's 95% organic ingredient requirement to be called \"Organic\" Organic soaps are free from harmful chemicals like phthalates and triclosan, which promotes healthier skin and reduces the risk of irritation and allergies. Non-toxic soaps often contain nutrient-rich natural oils and plant-based ingredients that provide essential nutrients and antioxidants, nourishing and enhancing skin health. Certifications such as USDA Organic, Leaping Bunny, Made Safe, and Fair Trade ensure these products meet high standards for safety, sustainability, and ethical practices. Switch to non-toxic soaps with organic ingredients to enjoy healthier skin, support the environment, and avoid exposure to harmful chemicals.

I used to battle hormonal imbalances, breakouts, and dullness, trying every product out there with little success. It wasn\u2019t until I healed my gut and balanced my blood sugar that my skin truly transformed. My skin transformed when I began eating whole, organic foods and eliminated toxins from my daily environment. This shift was part of my broader commitment to non-toxic living, which has shaped not only my skincare routine but every aspect of my lifestyle. The final step? Switching to a non-toxic skincare routine. It wasn\u2019t just about ditching harmful chemicals (though that was a huge part of it), but avoiding the common pitfalls of over-cleansing, over-exfoliating, and stripping away the oils our skin actually needs. The result? Calmer, healthier, radiant skin. Even with a busy life\u2014childcare, work, and everything in between\u2014I keep my routine simple and quick. It\u2019s my moment of self-care, and it helps me feel good inside and out. Below, I\u2019ll walk you through my current clean skincare routine so you can create a healthy, clean beauty regimen that fits your lifestyle.  Our skin is our largest organ, and what we apply, meaning toxic ingredients in conventional products, can get absorbed into our bloodstream. They often contain harmful chemicals like parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances that can disrupt hormones, irritate the skin, and contribute to long-term health issues. By embracing clean natural skincare products, you\u2019re nourishing your skin and body with safe, natural ingredients. By switching to clean, non-toxic skincare brands, you\u2019re choosing products free from these dangerous ingredients. Instead, you\u2019ll be nourishing your skin with natural, safe alternatives that not only soothe irritation but also support your body\u2019s natural healing processes. Here\u2019s a breakdown of my morning and evening routines, along with tips to help you avoid common skincare mistakes and stay on track with a clean beauty regimen.  Washing your face in the morning can strip away your skin\u2019s natural oils, which act as essential moisturizers. Instead of a cleanser, I gently wipe my face with a cotton pad soaked in filtered water. This keeps my skin hydrated and balanced without disrupting its natural barrier. This valuable tip comes from Jamie Maguire, an advocate for natural beauty and gut health, and I\u2019ve found it incredibly effective. After refreshing my skin, I apply a peptide mist to hydrate and prep my skin. It acts as a toner, setting the stage for clean moisturizers and serums. Primally Pure Everything Spray* OSEA Sea Minerals Mist* Josh Rosebrook Hydrating Accelerator* Activist Skincare - Healing Water Toning Mist* I follow up with a clean antioxidant serum to protect my skin from environmental stressors. My Favorite Clean Serums: Annmarie Skincare - Probiotic Serum with Tremella* Activist Active Hydration Vitamin C+ Antioxidant Serum * 100% Pure - Multi-Vitamin + Antioxidants Potent PM Serum* OSEA SEA Hyaluronic Acid Serum* I apply a stem cell serum to promote skin rejuvenation and regeneration. My Top Natural Stem Cell Serums: Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Anti-Wrinkle Booster Serum* AnnMarie Citrus Stem Cell Serum* True Botanicals \u2013 Renew Repair Nightly Treatment* I finish my routine with a moisturizer and a tinted SPF, which doubles as my makeup. Non-toxic mineral face sunscreens protect without irritating the skin. My favorite Natural SPF moisturizers & Tinted SPF Keys Luminos PLUS with Zinc Oxide* Ilia Beauty - Super Serum Skin Tint SPF 40*  To round out my makeup routine, I set my brows with the W3LL People Expressionist Brow Gel* for a polished look, and I finish everything off with Ilia Limitless Lash Mascara*   Your evening skincare routine is crucial for allowing your skin to repair and rejuvenate overnight. My routine focuses on gentle yet effective products that work harmoniously to support the skin\u2019s natural barrier without overwhelming it. Step 1: Double Cleanse If you\u2019ve been wearing heavy makeup or sunscreen during the day, a double cleanse is the perfect way to start. This ensures that all layers of product and impurities are removed, so your skin can properly breathe and better absorb your evening treatments. \u2022 First Cleanse: I use an oil cleanser or micellar water to dissolve and remove makeup, sunscreen, and excess oils. I love using Primally Pure\u2019s Cleansing Oil* \u2022 Second Cleanse: I follow with a water-based gentle non toxic cleanser to wash away any remaining dirt. Annmarie Skin Care Cleanser with Aloe Vera * 100% Pure Organic Rose Water Sensitive Skin Cleanser* Juice Beauty Stem Cellular 2-in-1 Cleanser* Step 2: Apply a Peptide Mist A peptide mist just like in my morning routine hydrates and preps my skin for the serums and oils or mositurers to follow. Step 3: Retinaldehyde, Vitamin A Serums and Moisturizer Cocktail Instead of the more common retinol, which is synthetic and can be too harsh, I use retinal \u2014a gentler yet effective form of vitamin A. It provides similar anti-aging benefits, like boosting collagen and improving skin texture, without irritating or thinning the skin. This makes it ideal for sensitive skin types (which is perfect for me!) I mix a vitamin A serum with my favorite moisturizer or moisturizing oil. I also love to combine a cream with a nourishing facial oil. This cocktail provides a protective barrier while deeply moisturizing your skin, ensuring you wake up with hydrated, plump skin. My favorite Serums  Primally Pure Plumping Serum* (use code Orbasics for 10% off) Annmarie Skin Care \u2013 Wild Fruit Serum* Primally Pure Fancy Face Serum Regenerate* (use code Orbasics for 10% off) My Favorite Moisturizers Primally Pure Antioxidant Balm* (use code Orbasics for 10% off) 100% Pure Bakuchiol Moisturizer* Ursa Major Golden Hour Recovery Cream* Juice Beauty STEM CELLULAR Moisturizer* True Botanicals Renew Pure Radiance Oil* Step 5: Eye Cream or Serum As the final step, I gently apply an eye serum to the delicate skin around my eyes My favorite Eye Creams Annmarie Fruit Ceramide Eye Serum* OSEA Ocean Eyes* 100 % Pure Super Fruit Oil Nourishing Eye Cream* Bright Start Retinol Alternative Eye Cream* I love taking my favorite non-toxic masks to the sauna, which I visit 2-3 times a week. Sauna sessions help detoxify the skin, giving the skin a radiant glow. The heat and sweat from the sauna naturally exfoliate the skin, revealing fresh, new skin cells and improving overall texture. Did you know, that sauna use has been linked to a longer lifespan, with studies suggesting it can reduce mortality rates by up to 40% ? My favorite face masks:  Primally Pure Plumping Face Mask* Soothing Spirulina Face Mask* 100% Pure Vitamin C Mask* AnnMarie Illuminating Pearl Mask* M\u00c1DARA Organic Brightening AHA Peel Mask*  Now that you know my skincare routine, it\u2019s important to remember that skincare goes beyond just the products you apply to your skin. The ingredients matter just as much. By choosing non-toxic, clean beauty products, you\u2019re not only supporting your skin but also promoting overall health and wellness. Here are some of my key tips to help you maintain a safe and effective skincare routine: Avoid products with alcohol, fragrances, and synthetic chemicals. Harmful chemicals can irritate the skin and disrupt the body\u2019s natural balance. A helpful resource is the Environmental Working Group (EWG) database or other ingredient checkers, which list harmful ingredients to avoid in skincare. Harsh treatments like chemical peels, CO2 lasers, and regular retinol use can weaken the skin barrier over time, causing sensitivity. Instead, opt for gentle alternatives like retinaldehyde, which offers anti-aging benefits without irritation. I also recommend facial massages and Gua Sha as effective non-invasive methods for improving skin texture and boosting collagen production. I believe that gut health is deeply intertwined with skin health. After addressing gut imbalances, I noticed remarkable improvements in my skin. It\u2019s important to nourish your body from the inside out by avoiding processed foods, reducing sugar, and eating nutrient-dense meals. Incorporating probiotics and fermented foods into your diet can also support a healthy gut microbiome, which in turn promotes clear, glowing skin. I incorporate microneedling into my skincare routine 2-3 times a year, typically during the winter season. This treatment helps remove dead skin cells and stimulates collagen production, giving the skin a smoother, firmer appearance. I allow about 5-6 weeks between sessions and take extra care to avoid sun exposure during this time. Microneedling is one of my favorite ways to keep my skin looking revitalized while maintaining its strength.  In addition to carefully selected products, I\u2019ve found that incorporating some beauty tools can elevate your skin health in a gentle, holistic way. These tools are an excellent complement to my skincare philosophy: \u2022 Gua Sha Stones* and Face Rollers*: I love using Gua Sha made of natural stones to promote lymphatic drainage and improve blood circulation. Regular sessions help lift and tone the skin, reduce puffiness, and give a radiant glow. If my Gua Sha stone isn\u2019t available, I opt for a deep tissue facial massage to activate collagen production. Both methods are nurturing and non-invasive, helping me maintain healthy, glowing skin. \u2022 High-Frequency Devices like High-Frequency Wands*: Tools like high-frequency wands are excellent for treating blemishes. They use gentle electrical currents to reduce inflammation and kill bacteria, making them ideal for keeping skin clear without irritation. \u2022 Minimal Stripping: Taking inspiration from Jamie Maguire, I avoid chemical peels and invasive lasers. I focus on being gentle and nurturing my skin barrier to support long-term health and balance. \u2022 The Gut-Skin Connection: Gut health plays a major role in skin health. By improving my gut, I saw a noticeable change in my complexion, and I firmly believe healthy skin starts from within. This holistic approach to skincare makes a lasting difference. \u2022 Consistency Over Trends: Consistency is the key to long-term skin health. Instead of chasing trends or quick fixes, focus on building a reliable, non-toxic skincare routine with nourishing ingredients that support your skin\u2019s resilience.  \u2022 Avoid Over-Cleansing: Too much cleansing strips your skin of natural oils, which can compromise the barrier and cause dryness. A simple water cleanse in the morning works best for me. \u2022 Non-Toxic Sun Protection: Always look for mineral-based sunscreens with non-nano zinc oxide or titanium dioxide to ensure effective and non-toxic protection. \u2022 Minimalist Routines: Simplicity and consistency are at the heart of good skincare. Start slow, be patient with results, and avoid overly complicated routines. \u2022 Nurture, Don\u2019t Strip: Opt for natural products that nourish and strengthen the skin rather than those that strip away its natural oils. It\u2019s important to focus on building healthy skin with minimal irritation. While I hope my nontoxic skincare routine is helpful to you, it\u2019s important to remember that everyone\u2019s skin is different, influenced by a variety of factors such as skin type, lifestyle, and even climate. Products that work wonders for me may not have the same effect for you, and vice versa. It\u2019s all about finding what nourishes your skin best and being patient with the process. Always listen to your skin, and don\u2019t be afraid to make adjustments based on its needs.

This topic has recently sparked growing concern\u2014and for good reason. Menstrual products, especially tampons, often come into direct contact with sensitive tissue, allowing hidden contaminants to enter the bloodstream more easily. I remember picking up my usual box of tampons at the start of my cycle without a second thought. That changed when I read studies revealing the presence of toxic metals (like lead, mercury, and arsenic) and other chemicals in tampons. Given how frequently these products are used\u201486% of women in the US and 42% in Europe rely on tampons monthly\u2014understanding their potential risks is vital. Studies have detected heavy metals, including lead and mercury! The same metals we're warned about contaminate our food and water. The presence of heavy metals in tampons is emerging as a significant public health concern, especially given how many people use these products monthly. Considering how tampons interact with sensitive tissue, this is a conversation we need to have\u2014not to alarm, but to critically inform. It\u2019s time to be aware of the facts, recognize existing gaps in research, and better understand how these products might impact our health\u2014so we can demand safer options and greater transparency. Let\u2019s explore what\u2019s lurking in tampons, from heavy metals to newer concerns like PFAS and microplastics, as well as recent moves toward stricter regulations. Tampons have been around for centuries, with their modern design emerging in the 20th century, to offer more convenience and flexibility. Today, in the modern world, they are indispensable to many, with the average person using around 7,400 tampons over their lifetime, if you're using four tampons a day! Tampons are more than cotton on a string. Their absorbent core is often made from cotton, rayon or a blend of both. Organic tampons stick to 100% cotton, but many conventional tampons include synthetic fibres, fragrances, dyes, and other additives! These extras may improve aesthetics and texture, but they introduce unwanted chemicals, making tampons one of the many everyday products that contain questionable substances\u2014often with minimal oversight or disclosure.  Image by Josefin on Unsplash The manufacturing process from raw cotton to a finished tampon, has lots of opportunities for potential contamination: Bleaching: Chlorine bleaching has historically been used to whiten tampons. While many manufacturers now use a chlorine-free process, questions remain about residual chemicals (e.g., dioxins) and trace metals introduced during these alternative bleaching methods. DyeingAesthetic dyeing often adds more chemical residues, including potential metal contaminants. Farming practices: Cotton crops in polluted soil can absorb heavy metals like lead and arsenic, these metals leach and can accumulate in the plant, which is then used to manufacture our tampons. Pesticides and fertilisersalso contribute to contamination, as arsenic is found in many fertilisers  Metals such as mercury, lead, arsenic, and cadmium have all been found in tampons. These metals are highly toxic; even at low levels, they can accumulate in the body over time. A recent study found toxic metals in tampons and detected all 16 metals in at least one tampon sample, with 12 metals found in 100% of the products tested. Lead study author, Jenni Shearston stated that \"we found 12 of the 16 metals we tested for, including some toxic metals like lead, present in 100% of the tampons we tested\". Shockingly, lead - a metal with no known 'safe' exposure level - was in all tampon samples. Interestingly, while non-organic tampons showed higher lead concentrations, organic cotton tampons had higher levels of arsenic - highlighting how manufacturing processes can affect metal content in complex ways. While heavy metal concentrations in tampons are low, these chemicals can accumulate in the body over time and have negative health effects. The increased risk comes with vaginal tissues being highly absorbent, allowing substances to pass into the bloodstream more easily compared to other routes. Alarmingly, there is little research on exactly how metals absorb through vaginal tissues, leaving critical questions unanswered. In Germany, a 2024 test by \u00d6KO-TEST on 23 tampon products also detected heavy metals but generally at lower levels compared to some US samples. Although the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) states these levels might be \u201cnegligible\u201d in an extreme worst-case scenario, the agency also emphasizes there is no safe threshold for lead\u2014and urges manufacturers to keep reducing these contaminants. But without more comprehensive data on absorption via vaginal tissue, the public cannot be fully reassured. Beyond toxic metals tampons may contain a range of other substances such as dioxins, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), phthalates, parabens, and synthetic fragrances. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) - Irritate sensitive tissues and may disrupt mucosal health. Parabens and phthalates - Linked to hormone disruption; used to prevent bacterial growth or improve product flexibility. Dioxins - Highly toxic byproducts of certain bleaching processes, classified as carcinogens. Fragrance - \u2018Scented\u2019 or \u2018fresh\u2019 tampons often contain synthetic fragrance, known to irritate or sensitize delicate vaginal tissue; can also increase infection risk.  The vaginal wall is an extremely sensitive mucous tissue, that has lots of small folds to increase its surface area. This anatomical feature allows heavy metals and other toxins to enter the bloodstream more easily\u2014potentially posing health risks that exceed those from oral exposure. Some of the potential health concerns related to long-term tampon use include: Hormonal disruption: Metals like cadmium and lead can mimic or block natural hormones, affecting your endocrine system, causing menstrual irregularities, thyroid disruption and even fertility issues Cancer risk: Heavy metals and dioxins are classified as carcinogenic, and are linked to cancers including cervical and uterine cancer, and others Organ Damage: Metals like mercury and others can accumulate in the organs, like the liver, brain, or kidney, causing long-term toxicity, and may even result in chronic illnesses like kidney disease or neurological disorders  Photo by Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition on Unsplash \"Although toxic metals are ubiquitous and we are exposed to low levels at any given time, our study clearly shows that metals are also present in menstrual products and that women might be at higher risk for exposure using these products,\" explains Kathrin Schilling from Columbia University Mailman School for public health. Other experts underscore that we simply don\u2019t have enough data to declare these exposure levels \u2018safe,\u2019 especially for substances like lead, which has no known risk-free dose. PFAS are sometimes called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they don\u2019t break down easily in the environment or the human body. They\u2019re linked to hormone disruption, immune system issues, and potential cancer risks. Emerging Research (2023\u20132024): PFAS have been detected in a range of consumer goods, including period products. Sometimes used for stain-resistance or moisture-wicking in period underwear, PFAS can also show up in tampons or packaging materials. Given these are persistent and bioaccumulative, any PFAS presence in tampons is especially worrisome. Microplastics have become a hot topic in environmental health discussions. Recent reports suggest that microplastics might be present in tampon packaging, applicators, or even the fibers themselves. Lack of Long-Term Data: While research is ongoing, preliminary evidence indicates microplastics could enter and accumulate in human tissues, with unknown but potentially harmful long-term consequences. The oversight of tampons varies across regions, the regulatory landscape for heavy metals in feminine hygiene products remain inconsistent: In the US, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) classifies tampons as medical devices, but there are no guidelines limiting the levels of heavy metals or other contaminants in them. Therefore, manufacturers aren't required to test for heavy metals or disclose chemical contaminants in their products. In Europe, the EU implements stricter regulations regarding chemicals in menstrual products. The EU's REACHregulations (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals) aim to limit the presence of chemicals in consumer products including metals and dioxins Increased public awareness\u2014sparked by new studies on heavy metals, PFAS, and microplastics\u2014is pushing governments and health organizations to consider setting clearer guidelines, since the reporting of heavy metals in tampons by the study mentioned earlier in this article. Keep an eye out for new legislative proposals in the EU or US aiming to hold manufacturers to stricter standards and require transparent labeling. Being mindful about the non-toxic products you use is a critical first step: Look for certifications: Products labeled as organic or toxin-free (e.g., GOTS, MADE SAFE\u00ae) are less likely to contain harmful chemicals\u2014though not automatically free from metals, as seen with arsenic in organic cotton. Avoid added fragrance, dyes, or unnecessary additives: If you\u2019re unsure, check whether the brand provides transparency on its manufacturing processes. Some menstrual product companies are setting a new standard for safety, transparency, and sustainability by adopting proactive measures to address consumer concerns about harmful chemicals and environmental impact. These efforts include: Obtaining Third-Party Certifications: Leading brands like Natracare* and Organyc* have achieved certifications such as GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standards), MADE SAFE\u00ae, and Soil Association Organic. These certifications ensure that products are free from harmful chemicals like pesticides, dioxins, and phthalates while adhering to strict environmental standards Transparent Labeling Practices: Companies such as Lola* disclose all ingredients used in their products, including fragrances and additives, on packaging or websites. This transparency empowers consumers to make informed choices about what they use on sensitive areas of their bodies Sustainable Manufacturing Practices: Brands like Natracare* and MoonPads* have introduced sustainablepractices such as compostable tampons and biodegradable packaging to reduce plastic waste. Others, such as Daye*, use sugarcane-based applicators and unbleached organic cotton to minimize environmental contaminants while maintaining product efficacy. Making an informed choice about menstrual products isn't always straightforward - even alternatives can come with their own considerations. Here's what I've learned through my research and personal experience: Menstrual cups: I swear by menstrual cups, I have had one for almost a year and it can changed the game for me! Made from medical-grade silicone, they're reusable, eco-friendly, and free from heavy metals. However, it's worth noting that silicone quality can vary between manufacturers, so I recommend choosing cups from reputable brands with transparent manufacturing practices. Organic Pads: Menstrual pads, specifically organic pads, can be safer disposable options than tampons. While organic pads avoid many of the chemicals found in conventional tampons, they're still made from materials that could contain trace contaminants. That said, they typically have less direct contact with sensitive tissue than tampons, potentially reducing exposure concerns. Period underwear is gaining popularity, especially for its convenience and comfort\u2014no more ruined underwear! While they're sustainable and reusable, recent studies have raised questions about PFAS (forever chemicals) in some brands' materials. If you're considering period underwear, look for brands that explicitly test for and certify their products as PFAS-free.  The key is to find what works best for you. Recognizing the trade-offs and staying informed will help you feel more confident about your decision, without falling into the trap of believing a \u201cperfectly safe\u201d product exists\u2014as manufacturing standards and research often lag behind consumer needs. Heavy metals (lead, mercury, arsenic) and other chemicals (dioxins, VOCs, phthalates, synthetic fragrances) can be found in tampons, raising serious safety questions. The vaginal wall is highly absorbent, which means toxins can more readily enter the bloodstream\u2014potentially disrupting hormones, increasing cancer risk, and damaging organs. Studies show non-organic tampons often have higher lead levels, while organic tampons can have more arsenic, illustrating the complexity of contamination sources. PFAS (\u201cforever chemicals\u201d) and microplastics are emerging as additional threats in menstrual products, accentuating the urgency for better testing and tighter regulations. While German tests indicate generally lower metal levels than some U.S. brands, no safe threshold for lead exists; experts remain concerned about understudied routes of exposure. Demand transparency and safer manufacturing: Seek certified organic or toxin-free options, avoid fragrances/dyes, and consider alternatives like menstrual cups, period underwear, or organic pads to reduce exposure. Yes, tampons can contain harmful chemicals, including heavy metals (lead, arsenic) and additives like PFAS or dioxins. Current regulations do not comprehensively limit these contaminants, leaving many questions about long-term safety. The potential negative effects of using tampons include exposure to toxic chemicals that may disrupt hormones, increase cancer risk, or cause organ toxicity over time. Heavy metals like lead and cadmium can accumulate in the body and harm the nervous, endocrine, and reproductive systems. Additionally, improper tampon use (e.g., leaving them in for too long) can lead to rare but serious conditions like toxic shock syndrome (TSS). While the long-term health effects of chemical exposure from tampons remain unclear, concerns about their impact on sensitive vaginal tissues persist. Bottom Line: While we may not have all the answers yet, evidence pointing to heavy metals and other contaminants in tampons underscores the need for more research, stricter regulations, and a push for transparency in the menstrual product industry. Note: Always consult reputable sources (such as the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, or the FDA in the U.S.) to stay updated on new research, testing results, and any emerging regulations related to heavy metals in tampons.

We may earn a commission on purchases, at no additional cost to you. Learn more \u2192 Most of us assume that if a product is sold in stores, it must be safe. Unfortunately, that\u2019s far from the truth. Many feminine hygiene products contain toxic chemicals like PFAS, parabens, phthalates, dioxins, bleach and even heavy metals. For example, did you know that nearly half of pads and and period underwear contain PFAS \"forever chemicals\"? All these substances can disrupt hormones, increase cancer risk, and irritate sensitive areas. With the average person using 11,000 tampons in their lifetime, prolonged exposure to potentially toxic ingredients raises serious health concerns. Yet, ingredient transparency is almost nonexistent. In this article we will pull back the curtain on what's really lurking in your menstrual products, how it impacts your health, and share safer, non-toxic alternatives to protect your health. But it\u2019s not just our pads and tampons we need to rethink\u2014everyday items like certain fabrics, plastics, and body-care products can also bring harmful chemicals into our bodies. We\u2019ll explore those, too, so you can reduce your toxic load from all angles.  Image by Monika Kozub on Unsplash Most of us do not realise that manufacturers aren't required to disclose all ingredients in tampons, pads or liners. These products are often made from a blend of natural and synthetic absorbent fibres, plastics, adhesives, cotton and rayon, and many contain toxic chemicals that can be absorbed into your body. Dioxins are byproduct of the chlorine bleaching process used in the production of rayon. Classified as highly toxic carcinogens by the WHO they have also been linked to immune system damage, reproductive issues like endometriosis and hormone disruption. Not to mention that once these chemicals enter the body, they persist for years and accumulate with continued exposure, meaning even low exposure can build up overtime. While manufactures have switched to chlorine-free bleaching, trace amounts of dioxins can still be found in some tampons. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals used to increased absorbency and prevent leaks. PFAS are endocrine disruptors, liked to hormone imbalances, fertility issues, weakened immune system and can increase your cancer risk. These chemicals are persistent in the environment and the human body once injested, hence their nickname \"forever chemicals\" A study reporting that 48% of sanitary pads, 22% of tampons, and 65% of period underwear contain PFAS, highlights how prominent these chemicals are in menstrual products! EDCs including phthalates, phenols, and parabens are found in synthetic fibres and adhesives used in menstrual products.These chemicals mimic hormones, causing irregular cycles, and could leading to reduced fertility, developmental problems and conditions including endometriosis A 2023 study confirmed menstrual products contain measurable levels of EDCs, making them a significant route of exposure. Non organic cotton is heavily pretreated with pesticides, herbicides and defoliants (a chemical that removes the leaves from trees and plants). Pesticides are neurotoxins and carcinogens, increased exposure may potentially lead to neurological disorders and increased cancer risk Amongst other chemicals, the herbicide glyphosate has been detected in tampons - One Argentinian study found that most of the cotton derived from feminine care products including tampons and pads, contained this chemical. VOCs like toluene and xylene, are commonly found in fragranced menstrual products, and have been associated with headaches, dizziness, hormone disruption and cancer risks. A 2021 study, found that tampon users were at higher risk of VOC exposure than pad users. Trace amounts lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic have been found in tampons (even in \"organic\" brands). Despite being found a low levels, these neurotoxins can have a cumulative effect damaging the nervous system, organs and increasing cancer risk. Dr Andrea Milbourne, gynaeocologist at the MD Anderson Cancer Cancer says \" Just because something is advertised as 'natural' doesn't mean its better for you, even organic tampons studied contained heavy metals\"  Marketed as a \u201cfreshness fix,\u201d douching disrupts vaginal pH, strips away protective bacteria, and increases infection risk. Worse, 67% of douches contain parabens, 41% phthalates, and many use formaldehyde-releasing preservatives\u2014all linked to hormonal disruption and irritation. \ud83d\udca1 Did you know? Women using glycerin-based douches face triple the risk of HIV transmission due to weakened vaginal defenses. Better Alternative: Skip the douches. Your vagina is self-cleaning. If irritation is an issue, look for pH-balanced, fragrance-free cleansers or breathable organic cotton underwear instead. Over-the-counter vaginal anti-itch creams aren\u2019t as harmless as they seem. Many contain corticosteroids, which thin vaginal tissue, making it 2.7x more absorbent to chemicals. Even so-called \"natural\" options often hide methylisothiazolinone, a 2024 allergen of the year, linked to severe skin reactions.Also pain relievers (like ibuprofen) may ease cramps but can damage gut health, disrupt hormone metabolism, and increase the risk of autoimmune conditions. \ud83d\udca1 Better Alternative: Instead of reaching for drugstore creams, try plant-based gels with quercetin phytosomes\u2014clinically shown to reduce histamine response by 89% without steroids.For pain relief consider holistic methods \u2014 like heat therapy, magnesium supplements, or herbal remedies\u2014and consult with a healthcare professional for persistent discomfort. While pads, tampons, and douches are a significant source of toxic chemical exposure, they aren\u2019t the only culprits. Everyday items\u2014from underwear and shampoo to plastics\u2014can also compromise vaginal and overall health. Here\u2019s a quick rundown: Polyester ClothingPolyester underwear may look appealing but exposes you to toxic chemicals like antimony, a known carcinogen. It can also trap moisture, irritating the sensitive vaginal area.Safer Swap: Switch to breathable natural fibers like organic cotton or bamboo to reduce irritation and chemical exposure. Shampoos & ConditionersConventional haircare products often hide phthalates, parabens, and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)\u2014all potential endocrine disruptors.Safer Swap: Look for phthalate-free and paraben-free products with plant-based formulas to cleanse effectively without adding to your toxic load. Pesticides in ProduceHormone-disrupting chemicals like glyphosate and atrazine are common in non-organic farming. Beyond affecting our food, these pesticides can accumulate in the body, potentially worsening hormonal imbalances.Safer Swap: Whenever possible, choose organic fruits and veggies or thoroughly wash (i.e. with baking soda) and soak conventional produce to reduce pesticide residues. Plastics EverywhereEven \u201cBPA-free\u201d plastics may contain BPS or BPF, which can still disrupt hormones. These chemicals leach into food and drinks, especially when heated.Safer Swap: Opt for glass or stainless-steel containers and water bottles to minimize plastic exposure. You shouldn't have to second-guess what's in your period products, with the average exposure time being 4-8 hours, it is important you know exactly what is in your products! Especially as the vaginal mucous membranes (the cell lining of vagina) absorb substances quickly, although ideal for medication delivery, this can put us more at risk with all these hidden chemicals in our period products and also affect our vaginal microbiome! Endocrine Disruption & Reproductive Concerns Many chemicals in feminine hygiene products like PFAS and EDCs (pthalates, parabens and phenols), are endocrine disruptors. These chemicals interfere with your body's hormone regulation, causing hormone imbalances, leading to irregular menstrual cycles, reduced fertility, and even conditions like endometriosis. Studies confirm tampon use for 14 years or more was associated with endometriosis risk! Cancer risk Certain chemicals like dioxins, heavy metals, PFAS, pesticides and VOCs not only result in an increased risk of cancer risk but these chemicals cause also cause organ damage, and many other issues. While these substances may be present in small amounts, studies indicate that cumulative exposure can still significant increase the risk of developing cancer overtime. Skin Irritation and Allergic Reactions Pads and tampons contain fragrances and synthetic fibres that can leave you feeling irritated, and (can even cause dermatitis!)- especially for those with sensitive skin. They do this by disrupting the natural pH balance of your vaginal area - some feminine wash products can do this too/1 Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) TSS is a rare but life-threatening condition linked to certain tampon materials, causing symptoms like high fever, vomiting, and a rash. It is crucial that if you are a tampon user, you follow the guidelines i.e changing them every 4-8 hours to mimimize this risk.  The harm from menstrual products isn't just personal - it's global. Every year, billions of pads, tampons, and panty liners are thrown away contributing to environmental pollutions. Creating colossal environmental waste and causing microplastics in our water supplies! This widespread issue is a focus of environmental health sciences, that examine how chemicals pollute our soil and water supplies - contaminating ecosystems and affecting marine wildlife too. Did you know - 3 billion disposable menstrual products are used every year in the UK alone, with 200,000 tonnes of menstrual waste ending up in landfill annually! A single pack of 14 menstrual pads contains as much plastic as 5 carrier bags! Not to mention that is takes between 500-800 years to naturally decompose If 20% of people in the EU used reusable menstrual products, it could prevent 100 tonnes of waste, every year! Which is an unbelievable stat! If these products are so harmful, why hasn't anything been done as it effects global and community health? The short answer: lack of oversight, outdated taboos, and a history of prioritizing convenience over safety No Pre-market Testing: Unlike food or drugs, menstrual products arent required to do safety testings. They are classified in a regulatory grey area - one that benefits manufacturers, not consumers Hidden Ingredients: Companies aren't legally required to disclose all ingredients in feminine care products, meaning consumers have no idea what's in their products. Vague terms like \"fragrance\" or \"absorbent materials\" keeping us in the dark! Stigma Over Safety: For decades, marketing has focused on making period products ultra-thin and discreet rather than ensuring they're free from toxic chemicals. Advocacy for Change: Activists are fighting for stronger regulations like Menstrual Product Rights to Know Act, which force companies to be transparent about their ingredients Did you know? The FDA (not EPA) oversees menstrual products but doesn\u2019t require premarket safety reviews - a loophole benefiting manufacturers There is an urgent need for routine health risk assessments to improve human health! The good news? You can make informed choice and take steps to minimize your exposure to harmful chemicals by choosing better non-toxic options. Choose Safer Products Look for organic cotton, chlorine-free and hypoallergenic labels Avoid menstrual products with artificial scents or dyes. Ditch wipes and sprays and opt for fragrance-free Check for third-party certifications like GOTs or OKEO-TEX, which ensure products meet strict safety requirements Research brands for transparency Some brands openly disclose their ingredients. If you are unsure, do a quick search on their website to verify transparency  Image by Monika Kozub on Unsplash Making the switch to more non-toxic, sustainable menstrual products can protect you from endocrine disruptors and the planet, some great options to consider include: Menstrual cups: Made from medical-grade silicone, they're eco-friendly, reusable, chemical-free. I have a mooncup, and would never go back! Some other brands to consider include DivaCup* and Saalt * \"Switching to a menstrual cup was a game-changer for me\" says Alex Bee, writer at Beauty Bay. \"Not only am I reducing waste, but also feel more in tune with my body.\" Reusable cloth pads: Eco-friendly, customizable and comfortable. Made from non-toxic fabrics, these pads are ideal for light or heavy flows. Period underwear: Convinient and chemical-free, brands like Diva are popular choices - but research to see if they contain PFAS! Also, avoid period underwear made of polyester and instead look for more natural fibres to further reduce your exposure! Alternative Period Products Comparison Alternative Product Description Potential Benefits Pros Cons Menstrual Cups Reusable cups made of medical-grade silicone or rubber Reduced waste, fewer chemicals, long-lasting Can be worn for up to 12 hours, comfortable for many people, suitable for swimming, cost-effective in the long term Limited size options, can be challenging to learn how to use, silicone is not biodegradable and difficult to recycle Reusable Pads Washable pads made from cotton, bamboo, or hemp, often with a combination of natural and synthetic materials Reduced waste, fewer chemicals, comfortable Gender-neutral designs, various sizes and materials available, breathable, often made with non-toxic materials, can be used for incontinence Can be expensive initially, may require more frequent changing than disposables, washing and drying can be inconvenient Period Underwear Absorbent underwear designed to be worn without additional products Convenience, comfort, reduced waste Gender-neutral, easy to use, comfortable and moisture-wicking High upfront cost, can be made of non-biodegradable synthetic fibers, some may contain PFAS Organic Tampons and Pads Disposable products made with organic cotton Biodegradable, fewer chemicals Reduced environmental impact, less exposure to potentially harmful chemicals Can be more expensive than conventional options, may not be as widely available When it comes to period products there is a lot of misinformation floating around. Let's address some common misconceptions: Most menstrual products aren't tested for safety before being sold. Unlike cosmetics, food and drugs, there is no federal requirement to test menstrual products. But you can protect yourself by choosing brands that are transparent about their ingredients. False! When properly cleaned and maintained, reusable menstrual products like menstrual cups, cloth pads, and period underwear can be just as hygienic - if not more - than disposables. Myth 3: \"Menstrual cups can cause infections\" It is true, menstrual cups have equal UTI risk to tampons but only if improperly cleaned ! When cleaned well with mild soap, and sterilised between cycles, menstrual cups are a safe option. They can reduce your exposure to chemicals found in many disposable products. Once you get the hang of it, a menstrual cup can be less irritating on the skin, and more comfortable that traditional products . But again, be aware, proper sanitation is critical to avoid bacterial growth.  Feminine hygiene products can contain chemicals like dioxins, PFAS, phthalates, and parabens\u2014linked to hormonal imbalances, reproductive issues, and even cancer. Everyday items such as polyester underwear, certain hair-care products, over-the-counter pain relievers, pesticide-laden produce, and plastic containers can further increase your toxic load. Label-checking and brand research are crucial: seek organic, fragrance-free, phthalate-free, or paraben-free options. Look for reputable third-party certifications like GOTs or OKEO-TEX. Holistic adjustments\u2014such as opting for organic foods, switching to glass or stainless steel containers, and using natural pain relief strategies\u2014can significantly reduce your chemical exposure. Your period products shouldn\u2019t put your health at risk. By choosing non-toxic, transparent brands, and paying closer attention to chemicals hidden in everyday items (like underwear fabrics, shampoos, and plastics) you reduce chemical exposure and  and better protect your hormones, fertility, and long-term health. protect your well-being. Every small switch truly counts\u2014for your body, your peace of mind, and the planet. \u00a0 Millie Chamberlain is a passionate medical writer based in London.

With so many brands jumping on the 'clean beauty' bandwagon, it's crucial to separate genuine non-toxic products from clever marketing. Here's your guide to navigating the sometimes murky waters of green beauty claims In the beauty industry, greenwashing is a common tactic used to mislead consumers into believing products are more natural, organic, or eco-friendly than they truly are. Here are some key points to help you navigate these deceptive practices and make informed choices: 1. Understand the Labels While products may be labeled as \"natural\" or \"organic,\" these terms aren't strictly regulated. A product can be labeled as natural or organic yet still contain synthetic chemicals. For meaningful assurances, look for the COSMOS and EcoCert seals, which indicate the product meets stringent nontoxic standards. Additionally, look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, known for its hydrating properties and often found in high-quality skincare formulations. 2. Beware of Unregulated Claims Terms like \"hypoallergenic\" can be misleading, as they are not regulated. This means manufacturers can make such claims without any verification, designed to instill consumer confidence rather than ensure safety. Always scrutinize the ingredient list and research the brand's reputation. 3. Know the Limits of FDA Regulation The FDA has limited power to regulate cosmetics. Unlike food and drugs, cosmetic ingredients do not require pre-market approval. The FDA does not have the authority to recall products or enforce mandatory reporting of adverse effects. This means consumers are largely reliant on manufacturers to self-report issues. 4. Be Skeptical of Ingredient Transparency Cosmetic labels often lack full transparency. Ingredients listed as \"fragrance\" can hide a cocktail of over 3,000 chemicals, many of which are harmful. Companies claim proprietary rights to avoid listing these ingredients, leaving consumers in the dark about potential health risks. 4. Leverage Safe Cosmetics Resources The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics (CSC) is a valuable resource for consumers aiming to avoid greenwashing. CSC educates the public about harmful chemicals in beauty products, advocates for stronger regulations, and promotes transparency in the cosmetics industry. By referencing their guidelines and resources, you can make more informed decisions about the products you use. By being informed and cautious, you can avoid falling prey to greenwashing and ensure that your beauty products are truly safe and eco-friendly. In addition to choosing safe ingredients, we should also find a foundation that matches our skin tone perfectly. Determine Your Undertone: Identify if your skin has warm, cool, or neutral undertones. Warm undertones have yellow, peachy, or golden hints, cool undertones have pink, red, or blue hues, and neutral undertones are a blend of both. Test in Natural Light: Note that the shade matching was pretty difficult online so always check foundation swatches in natural daylight to see the true color. Store lighting can be deceptive. Swatch Multiple Shades: Apply three shades closest to your skin color along your jawline and blend them in. The one that disappears seamlessly is your match. Consider Seasonal Changes: Your skin tone can change with the seasons, becoming darker in the summer and lighter in the winter. You might need different shades for different times of the year. Match to Your Neck: Ensure the foundation matches your neck to avoid a visible line between your face and neck. Know Your Skin Type: Choose a formula that suits your skin type. Matte foundations work well for oily skin while hydrating or dewy foundations are better for dry skin. Use Online Tools: Many skincare brands offer virtual try-on tools and quizzes to help you find the right shade based on your skin tone and undertone. Ask for Samples: When in doubt, ask for samples from the store. This allows you to test the foundation over a few days to ensure it\u2019s the perfect match and works well with your skin. Check for Oxidation: Some foundations can oxidize and change color after application. Wear the foundation for a few hours to see if it stays true to its initial shade. Consult a Professional: If you\u2019re still unsure, a makeup artist or beauty consultant can help you find your ideal foundation match. Switching to non-toxic foundations eliminates exposure to harmful chemicals, reducing risks of allergies, irritation, and long-term health issues like hormonal imbalances and cancer. When choosing a foundation, consider your skin type, undertone, and seasonal changes. Test shades in natural light and look for brands with certified organic ingredients and certifications like Green America Certified Business, USDA Organic or Leaping Bunny to ensure safety and eco-friendliness. Clean foundations use natural ingredients like aloe, jojoba oil, and zinc oxide, which are gentle on the skin and provide benefits like hydration and SPF protection. We hope this guide has inspired you to explore the wonderful world of non toxic foundations. Remember, your skin is your largest organ \u2013 it deserves the very best care.

The first attempt at bringing a prickly little brush, dipped in black paste, that close to your eye is an experience you likely found intimidating. Our eyes, delicate and precious, naturally invoke an instinct to protect them - thank you, involuntary blink! Given the sensitivity of our eyes, it becomes essential to consider the composition of the cosmetics we use, especially something as intimate as mascara. So when it comes to what makes up that pigmented paste - it's only natural that we go for clean beauty products that are made from the best ingredients - Ingredients that don't contain harmful chemicals like PFAS that lead to tear film instability, dry eye, and even ocular surface disease. Our fascination with accentuating our eyes isn't a new fad. As a species, we've been using eye makeup since as far back as 6000 BCE, starting with the Egyptians. But unlike their burnt almonds and ash, modern formulations of conventional makeup have devolved to use ingredients that don't belong anywhere close to our eyes and face. Let's explore the brands pioneering in clean non-toxic mascara. It's time to get back to what's natural.  Image by Aleks on Unsplash In the world of eye cosmetics, terms like 'clean mascara' and 'natural mascara' are often used interchangeably, but they signify different qualities. Understanding these differences is key to making informed choices about the products we use. This term generally refers to products free from potentially harmful chemicals commonly found in conventional mascaras. These toxic chemicals can include a range of substances that are linked to various health concerns. Clean mascaras prioritize safety, using ingredients that are less likely to cause harm to the eyes and usually, this also translates to being better for the environment. Natural mascaras, are typically made from ingredients found in nature. These mascaras often feature enriching elements like shea butter for moisture, olive oil for smooth application, carnauba wax for structure, and sunflower seed oil for nourishment. The emphasis here is on using components that are minimally processed and closer to their original, natural state. However, it's important to note that 'natural' doesn't automatically mean safer or better, as some natural substances can be irritants or allergens for certain individuals. So what are the best clean and natural mascaras?

Image by yunona uritsky on Unsplash Parabens (Butylparaben, Methylparaben, Propylparaben): Often used as preservatives, parabens can mimic estrogen and have been linked to hormonal imbalances, potential fertility issues, and increased cancer risk. Phthalates: Commonly used to improve mascara texture, phthalates are known for their potential to disrupt hormone function, which can affect reproductive health. Fragrances: Many mascaras contain artificial fragrances which can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions, especially around the sensitive eye area. Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde-Releasing Preservatives: Used for their antimicrobial properties, these substances can cause allergic reactions and are classified as human carcinogens. Propylene Glycol: This can lead to skin irritation and potentially cause dermatitis and hives. Carbon Black (Ci 77266, Black 2): A pigment used for deep dark coloring in mascaras, linked to increased risk of cancer and adverse effects on organs. Aluminum Powder: Used as a colorant, aluminum powder is a neurotoxin and has been linked to brain and nerve damage. Natural mascaras should be formulated with ingredients that are safe, non-irritating, and nourishing to the lashes. Here's what you can expect to see listed on your natural mascara: Natural Waxes (like Carnauba and Beeswax): For texture and hold, without clogging pores or causing lash damage. Natural Oils (Almond Oil, Argan Oil): For nourishment, conditioning, and smooth application. Mineral-Based Pigments: Safer alternatives for coloring, avoiding the risks associated with conventional dyes. Some are even pigmented with fruit! Plant-Derived Ingredients: Such as extracts and butters, for gentle, non-irritating lash enhancement. EWG Verified: This certification means the product avoids ingredients known to pose health risks, according to the strict standards of the Environmental Working Group. Made Safe: Specifically relevant to non-toxic products, Made Safe certification ensures that products are free from known harmful chemicals, including behavioral toxins, carcinogens, developmental toxins, neurotoxins, and more. This certification is particularly relevant for products like mascara, which are used near sensitive areas like the eyes. Organic Certifications: Such as USDA Organic or ECOCERT, are also important as they indicate that ingredients are sourced from organic farming, minimizing exposure to synthetic pesticides and chemicals. Cruelty-Free and Vegan: These certifications like leaping bunny , while not directly related to chemical content, indicate ethical production practices, including no animal testing and the absence of animal-derived ingredients. In the realm of cosmetics, the term \"chemical-free\" can be misleading since all substances, including water, are technically chemicals. The focus, therefore, should be on avoiding mascaras with potentially harmful chemicals. Modern mascaras often utilize a variety of ingredients for color, texture, and stability. Many of these ingredients, such as carbon black for deep pigmentation, film-forming agents, and preservatives, can be derived from sources like coal tar, plastic, and petroleum. These substances, while effective for achieving desired cosmetic effects, can raise concerns regarding skin and eye safety. Make sure to look for mascaras that specifically state they are free from known harmful ingredients, and always double \u0192uncheck the list of ingredients. PFAS are synthetic chemicals used for their durability and water resistance, but they pose potential health risks. Opt for brands that explicitly state their products are PFAS-free. Our list here, in addition to the Environmental Working, Group's (EWG) database can be a helpful resource in identifying such products. Your journey to a non-toxic lifestyle may have started with a few small steps. And this is the perfect pace for a sustainable change. Maybe you've already transitioned to products like clean lipsticks\u00a0and non toxic foundation,\u00a0non-toxic perfumes and deodorants, recognizing how important it is to avoid harmful chemicals in the products that come into close contact with your body.

Best Non Toxic Lip Balms for Soft & Healthy Lips Top Skincare & Cosmetics Ingredient Checker Apps Yes, healthy mascaras are those that avoid potentially harmful ingredients and prioritize safe, nurturing components. They often come with certifications like EWG Verified or Made Safe to assure their safety standards. Organic mascaras, made from ingredients that are grown without the use of pesticides, offer a gentler alternative for your eyelashes. These ingredients, certified for their organic origin, are less likely to contain residues of harmful chemicals, making them a healthier choice for both your eyelashes and overall well-being. The organic certification ensures that the product adheres to strict standards regarding ingredient sourcing and production, providing an added layer of assurance about its safety and quality. Natural mascara can be a better choice for those looking for products with minimal processing and synthetic additives. However, 'natural' doesn't always guarantee safety, so it's essential to check the ingredient list and certifications. Conventional mascaras can contain chemicals like parabens, phthalates, and PFAS, which have been linked to various health concerns. Choosing certified non-toxic mascaras helps avoid these harmful chemicals. The list above offers a variety of safe alternatives to traditional mascara, each carefully selected for its adherence to safety and health standards. Look for non-toxic ingredients and certifications like EWG Verified, Made Safe, and USDA Organic. Also, look for mascaras that have been ophthalmologist-tested to indicate the formulas are safe for sensitive eyes. While a truly waterproof mascara usually requires synthetic ingredients that are not natural and are often harmful, there are safe water-resistant options. Ere Perez, for example, offers a natural waterproof mascara, providing durability without harsh chemicals. *The links are so-called 'affiliate links.'

Health Concerns: Fragrances are a common cause of allergic reactions and skin irritation, particularly in the sensitive area around the eyes. 4. Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde Releasing Preservatives (FRPs): Use: Preservatives used to prevent bacteria growth. Health Concerns: Known carcinogens, these chemicals can also trigger skin irritation, allergic reactions, and are harmful if inhaled. 5. Heavy Metals (Lead, Arsenic, Mercury, and Chromium): Use: Often found as contaminants in pigments used to color cosmetics. Health Concerns: These metals can accumulate in the body over time, leading to toxicity. They are known to cause neurological damage, skin irritation, and in some cases, cancer. 6. Phthalates (Dibutyl Phthalate, DEHP, DBP): Use: Used to increase the durability and flexibility of cosmetic products. Health Concerns: Linked to hormonal disruptions, reproductive issues, and developmental defects. 7. Synthetic Dyes (FD&C Colors): Use: Artificial colors used to give eyeshadows a vibrant hue. Health Concerns: Some synthetic dyes can cause allergic reactions and skin irritation. Certain dyes are suspected to be carcinogenic. 8. Ethanolamines (MEA, DEA, TEA): Use: Used as emulsifiers or foaming agents in cosmetics. Health Concerns: These compounds can react with other chemicals to form nitrosamines, which are known carcinogens. 9. Silicones (Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone): Use: Used to give products a silky texture and fill in fine lines and wrinkles. Health Concerns: While generally considered safe, silicones can trap dirt and sweat beneath the skin, potentially leading to irritation or acne outbreaks. 10. Mineral Oil: Use: A common ingredient in makeup for its moisturizing properties. Health Concerns:\u00a0It can clog pores, trapping bacteria and irritating skin which can cause acne.  Organic eyeshadows step up the game by blending beauty with nature: they are made with ingredients grown free from synthetic additives, pesticides, and fertilizers. Rich in natural pigments and nourishing botanicals, organic eyeshadows promise a velvety silky texture and vibrant colors, sourced from the heart of nature. For a product to be labeled \"organic,\" it should be certified by recognized standards such as USDA Organic or EcoCert. These products must contain a high percentage of organic ingredients grown without pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms. By supporting organic practices, organic eyeshadows also help minimize environmental impact while delivering deep, lasting colors enhanced with the goodness of jojoba oil, argan oil, or shea butter for healthy, vibrant eyelids. When choosing non-toxic eyeshadows, certifications are your best friends. These labels help you verify that what you're buying meets stringent health, safety, and environmental standards. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key certifications to look for: USDA Organic: Products with this certification must contain at least 95% organic ingredients, ensuring that they are free from synthetic additives and produced through environmentally friendly farming methods. EcoCert: This certification focuses on the ecological and sustainable practices of cosmetic products, guaranteeing that they contain a significant amount of natural and organic ingredients. Leaping Bunny: A must-have certification for cruelty-free beauty enthusiasts, this label ensures that no new animal testing is used in any phase of product development by the company, its laboratories, or suppliers. EWG Verified: The Environmental Working Group\u2019s mark certifies that products are free from EWG\u2019s chemicals of concern and fully disclose their ingredients, promoting transparency. By looking for these certifications, you can be more confident in your purchases  If you're new to eyeshadow or looking to refine your technique, here are some tips to get you started: Invest in Quality Brushes: Good tools can transform your eyeshadow application, helping blend colors smoothly. Use a Primer: A primer can help shadows stick better and last longer, preventing creasing, our team\u00b4s favorite is Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Eye Primer* Start with Neutral Shades: Build your confidence by mastering a few basic looks before moving on to bolder, vibrant colors. Selecting the right eyeshadow color can enhance your natural beauty and make your eyes pop. Consider your eye color, skin tone, and the occasion before choosing a palette. Here\u2019s a quick guide: For fair skin tones, cool-toned eyeshadows like pinks, lavenders, and soft blues tend to be the most complementary. Warmer hues like peaches, roses, and champagnes can also work beautifully to add a healthy glow. Medium skin tones have more flexibility when it comes to eyeshadow shades. Warm browns, bronzes, and golden tones accentuate olive and honey-hued complexions. Plums, mauves, and dusty roses also flatter medium skin beautifully. Avoid eyeshadows that are too light or washed out, as they can make the eyes appear dull. Those with deeper skin tones often look stunning in rich, saturated eyeshadow colors. Jewel-toned emeralds, sapphires, and deep purples make eyes pop. Metallics like copper, gold, and bronze add gorgeous dimension. Matte neutral shades like chocolate, espresso, and charcoal also work well to create a sultry, smoldering look. Regardless of your skin tone, it's important to consider your eye color as well. Brown / Dark Eyes: Virtually any color can work, but purples and blues can be particularly striking. Blue Eyes: Warm tones like copper and bronze can highlight blue eyes beautifully. Green Eyes: Shades of purple and pink can make green eyes appear even more vivid.  Look for eyeshadows that are formulated without harmful chemicals and are labeled as hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic. Natural mineral-based eye makeup is often a safer choice, especially for those with sensitive eyes. These products typically contain fewer irritants and are free from aggressive chemicals, making them a gentler option. Not all eyeshadows are created equal, and some formulations contain ingredients that might surprise you. Certain minerals such as certain heavy metals (like lead or arsenic), synthetic dyes, and colorants used in eyeshadows, while delivering vibrant hues, can pose risks if they're not properly formulated. For instance, some pigments approved for cosmetic use in general might not be safe for the sensitive areas around your eyes due to their potential for irritation or allergic reactions. Many brands have responded to consumer demand for safer products by offering talc-free eyeshadows. To ensure an eyeshadow is talc-free, always check the product's ingredient list. Brands like ILIA* and bareMinerals* often provide talc-free options. The choice between powder and cream eyeshadow often depends on your skin type and the finish you desire: Cream Eyeshadow: Better for dry or mature skin as it tends to be more hydrating and provides a dewy finish. It's also less likely to settle into fine lines. Powder Eyeshadow: Ideal for oily skin due to its ability to absorb excess oil and stay put for longer durations without creasing. By considering these factors, you can choose the type of eyeshadow that best suits your needs and contributes to a healthier skincare and makeup routine. *The links are so-called 'affiliate links.'

If we want to truly freshen up our surroundings, non toxic air fresheners are the way to go. Smelling something unpleasant in our homes, cars, or shoes can be really irritating. We all want to breathe fresh air while reading our favorite books on the couch or cooking dinner in the kitchen. That's why many people turn to conventional air fresheners to cover up foul smells. However, these \"air fresheners\" can do more harm than good. They often contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can cause health problems like migraines, headaches, asthma attacks, and respiratory issues. To promote clean living and ensure our air fresheners serve their purpose, switching to non-toxic natural air fresheners is the best choice! Using essential oil-based sprays not only freshens the air but also provides therapeutic benefits. For instance, a lavender spray helps me relax before bedtime, while a citrus mint blend invigorates my mornings. These small changes have made a big difference in creating a healthier living environment for our families. In this article, we'll explore why conventional air fresheners can be dangerous and why it's important to switch to non-toxic alternatives. A non-toxic air freshener, also known as a chemical-free air freshener, improves indoor air quality without harsh chemicals. Unlike traditional air fresheners that may contain toxic chemicals like phthalates, benzene, formaldehyde, and other VOCs (volatile organic compounds), nontoxic versions use natural ingredients like natural essential oils and plant extracts. These options are safer for your health and the environment, lowering the risk of allergies, respiratory issues, hormonal disruption, neurological effects and even more serious health concerns. For instance, a non-toxic air freshener might use a mix of lavender and eucalyptus oils for a refreshing scent without synthetic additives. Home is our safe haven from the outside pollution, so it's important to choose our air fresheners carefully. We want something that truly freshens the air without adding toxic chemicals. That is why we carefully test each product to ensure its effectiveness in freshening the air and verify that its ingredients are truly non-toxic. We also check if their brand certifications and manufacturing processes meet our high standards.

Opening windows and doors allows indoor air to circulate, removing moisture and stale odors, and reducing indoor pollutants. Promoting good air flow also controls humidity levels and helps maintain a comfortable temperature in our home. Simmering a pot of water with herbs and spices like cinnamon, cloves, and rosemary can naturally scent your home. The essential oils released into the air have antiviral and antibacterial properties, providing additional health benefits. Using dried herb sachets in drawers or laundry hampers keeps clothes and linens smelling fresh while repelling moths and insects. To make dried herb sachets, simply fill small fabric pouches with your choice of dried herbs and tie them securely. You can also add a few drops of essential oil for extra fragrance. Using baking soda instead of conventional deodorizers avoids harmful chemicals and keeps the air fresh. To make a baking soda deodorizer, fill a small bowl or jar with baking soda and place it in the desired area, or mix baking soda with a few drops of essential oil for added fragrance. This natural solution freshens the air and fabrics, eliminating odors without harmful chemicals. To make an air and fabric freshener, combine one cup of water with a tablespoon of baking soda in a spray bottle. Add 10-15 drops of your favorite essential oil, then roll the bottle before spraying to ensure it's mixed well.  Non-toxic, natural air fresheners reduce exposure to harmful chemicals found in conventional air fresheners like VOCs, which can cause migraines, asthma attacks, and respiratory issues. When selecting non-toxic air fresheners, consider factors like effectiveness, ingredient safety, air freshener manufacturers certifications, and suitability for sensitive individuals and pets. Look for certifications such as Leaping Bunny, USDA, and FSC to ensure the product meets high standards for safety and eco-friendliness.

Learn more \u2192 If you're motivated to reduce your impact on our planet, learning what it means to live sustainably is the first step in the right direction. With the rise of social media and the increasing availability of eco-friendly products, sustainable living has become more popular than ever. Yet, sustainable lifestyle is a broad term. While we often see influencers sharing their aesthetically pleasing zero-waste lives, sustainable living can actually look different for everyone. When I first heard about sustainable living, I thought I needed to buy all the trendy 'zero waste' products and drastically change my lifestyle. But it doesn't have to be that way. That mindset can, in fact, hold you back from starting a sustainable lifestyle or make the journey more challenging. That's why we've created this comprehensive guide to help you understand what sustainable living is and how you can easily live sustainably without feeling frustrated. So, let's get started!  Sustainable living is all about reducing the impact of our lifestyle choices on the environment and being socially responsible. In other words, living sustainably is not just about the environment but also about fairness and a better life for all. This can include reducing the use of Earth's natural resources, choosing products made under fair conditions, cutting down on plastic waste, reducing your carbon footprint, minimizing food waste, etc. Now I know what sustainable living means I take a more holistic approach to my life, I prioritize the environment, my health, and others. But to stay motivated in the long run and never lose focus it\u2019s also important to know why these sustainable lifestyle choices matter to you, society, and the planet as a whole. Sustainable living has three main pillars, often referred to as the \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d or the \u201c3 Ps\u201d: People, Planet, and Profit. Getting these pillars right is key to a truly sustainable life and society. The \u201cPeople\u201d pillar is about social equity and fair treatment for all. This means: Fair work practices and conditions Education and healthcare Community development and support Cultural preservation and diversity Human rights and social justice In reality this might mean supporting businesses with ethical labour practices, volunteering in your community or advocating for policies that promote social equity. The \u201cPlanet\u201d pillar is about protecting and preserving our natural world. This means: Reducing carbon emissions and climate change Conserving natural resources and biodiversity Minimising pollution and waste Protecting ecosystems and wildlife habitats Promoting renewable energy and sustainable agriculture Implementing this pillar might mean eating a plant based diet, using renewable energy or getting involved in local conservation efforts. The \u201cProfit\u201d pillar acknowledges the need for economic sustainability. It\u2019s about making sustainable practices economically viable in the long term. This means: Creating sustainable business models Promoting circular economy principles Investing in green technologies and innovations Balancing economic growth with environmental and social responsibility Encouraging responsible consumption and production On an individual level this might mean supporting sustainable businesses, investing in ethical funds or choosing products with a lower environmental impact even if they cost a bit more. The secret to sustainable living is to balance these three pillars. Every decision we make - from the products we buy to the policies we support - should ideally consider all three: Is it socially equitable? (People) Is it environmentally friendly? (Planet) Is it economically viable? (Profit) It\u2019s not about being perfect, just making choices that balance these three pillars as best we can. Every little helps.  Living sustainably allows us to be a force for good and improve our quality of life. Besides making us feel good about our lifestyle choices, living sustainably has many benefits for our health, our finances, our planet and everyone who lives on it. By reducing the environmental impact of our actions and supporting fair practices we help create a better world for all living things and future generations. Let\u2019s see the environmental, economic and social benefits of living sustainably: Environmental protection: Sustainable practices help you protect ecosystems, preserve natural resources, promote biodiversity, fight climate change, prevent pollution, reduce waste and more. Healthy habits: Living sustainably can help you make healthier food choices, reduce your exposure to toxic chemicals, get more physical activity with eco-friendly transport options, feel more purpose and fulfilled. Reduced expenses: Sustainability is also a smart financial move. Sustainable practices can lower your utility bills, save you money in the long run and cut costs on disposable items, fuel and overall consumption. Social connections: A sustainable lifestyle can also help you meet like-minded people, share similar experiences and build meaningful relationships. Fair labor standards: Choosing products made fairly means a system where workers are paid fairly, work in safe conditions and are treated with respect. Future security: The choices we make today will pave the way for a sustainable future so that future generations have access to the same resources we do today. Now that you know what sustainable living is and why it's important, it's time to show you a cheat sheet that will make making sustainably-minded decisions a breeze!  The 7 Rs of sustainable living are a set of principles that are essential for a more sustainable lifestyle: Refuse: Avoid buying or acquiring unnecessary items that will go to waste. Rethink: Reflect on your choices and look for more sustainable alternatives. Reduce: Cut down on your consumption of new stuff, especially disposable items. Reuse: Find creative ways to use items multiple times before discarding them. Repair: Fix broken or damaged items instead of throwing them away. Recycle: Collect your recyclables and take them to the nearest recycling facility. Rot (Compost): Turn organic waste into nutrient-rich soil for your garden. If this list feels like too much info, you can stick to the basic 3 Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. Once you've started to implement these basic rules, the rest will be easier to remember! We know that learning how to live sustainably can be overwhelming at first, so we want to make it easier and more enjoyable for you. That's why we've compiled simple yet impactful tips that will level up your sustainability game from zero to eco-warrior! Every decision we make has an indirect impact\u2014positive or negative\u2014on the environment and society. To live a more sustainable lifestyle, we have to reflect on our lifestyle choices so we can boost our positive impact and cut down on the negative. Small changes in our everyday life\u2014like how we move, the food we eat, the amount of water we use, the products we choose to buy, and even the candidates we support\u2014can have a significant impact. Looking to live a more sustainable lifestyle? Try starting with these easy changes: Changing our consumption patterns is probably the most challenging part of starting a sustainable lifestyle. And it becomes even harder when our economic system keeps promoting consumerism. We're constantly encouraged to buy the latest products, but this habit is highly detrimental to the environment. And let's be honest, we don\u2019t need much to be happy.  Here are a few simple ways to be a conscious consumer: Adopt a minimalist approach: Before buying something ask yourself: Do I need this? How often will I use it? Can I borrow it from a friend? Don\u2019t let emotions get the better of you, take a few days to think about it. Remember emotions can trigger impulse buying so giving yourself time helps you make more thoughtful decisions. Opt for durable products: Investing in high quality, durable items will pay off in the long run. Products designed to last and can be repaired will reduce the need for replacements and help you reduce waste and save money. Support small, sustainable businesses: Large corporations often have a bigger impact on the environment and their workers. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to support businesses that actually invest in sustainability and avoid those that don\u2019t. Believe it or not this puts more pressure on big corporations and forces them to do better. Avoid single-use products: Replacing disposable products like plastic water bottles, plastic bags and paper towels with reusable alternatives like reusable bags, beeswax wraps and a reusable water bottle is an easy way to live sustainably. We need to be mindful of our consumption habits to preserve resources. And we need to be especially careful about buying new clothes. Luckily there\u2019s ways to support sustainable fashion:  Avoid Fast Fashion: Fast fashion is responsible for about 10% of global carbon emissions. If you want to reduce your contribution to climate change, you should avoid trendy clothing that's designed for short-term use. Want to learn how to have a climate-friendly wardrobe? Check our guide slow fashion! Choose natural and organic materials: One of the things I hate about fast fashion is its disproportionate use of synthetic materials, such as polyester and nylon. When buying new wardrobe staples, look for clothes made of sustainable materials and natural fibers, like organic cotton and wool. Look for certifications: An easy way to identify sustainable fashion brands is to look for trustworthy third-party certifications, such as B Corp, GOTS, Fairtrade, Oeko-tex, and FSC. Care for your clothes properly: Textile waste is a huge environmental problem, so taking good care of your clothes is a must-do in your sustainable lifestyle. You can extend the lifespan of your clothes by washing them less frequently, using cold water, and learning how to mend clothes. Just as our clothing choices can impact the environment, so can the food we eat. Understanding the implications of our food choices is another important step toward a more sustainable lifestyle.  Our food choices are a crucial part of our sustainable lifestyle. There's something we usually take for granted: all the resources used to produce the food we eat. Producing the foods we love requires a lot of water and many of these foods leave behind a significant carbon footprint, contributing to climate change. When we let food go to waste, we're also wasting the energy, water, and other valuable resources that went into its production and transportation. Suppose that's not bad enough, when our food ends up in landfills. In that case, it generates potent greenhouse gas emissions\u2014specifically methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more harmful to our climate than carbon dioxide! Learn how to reduce the impact of your food: Choose organic produce: As you might know, organic farming methods are kinder to the environment. When possible, prefer organic produce and locally sourced, seasonal foods to support your local economy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote healthy ecosystems. Reduce meat consumption: Meat is a major source of pollution. Eating less meat, especially red meat is a simple way to help the planet. If like me you can\u2019t give up meat altogether, you can cut back on a few servings a week. Also instead of buying meat from big corporations, buy from small, local, and organic farmers. By knowing where your meat comes from and supporting sustainable farming practices you promote healthier ecosystems and animal welfare. Try visiting your local farmers market or joining a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program. It\u2019s a great way to connect with farmers and ensure you\u2019re getting ethically sourced products that you can feel good about. By making these choices you can be part of a more sustainable food system and still eat meat in moderation. Plan meals: Before heading to grocery stores, plan your meals, check what you already have at home, and make a grocery list. This is a smart way to ensure you buy only what you'll use and reduce food waste. Compost food scraps: Have some food scraps? Use a compost bin to reduce food waste and get nutrient-rich soil for your plants.  As kids, we were often reminded not to waste food. While it might have seemed repetitive at the time, it was pretty good advice. Another tip we might not have appreciated then was the need to conserve water and save energy at home. These two simple actions can make your home more sustainable while making a positive difference in both your wallet and the environment. There are many ways to be sustainable at home. Some people grow their sustainable gardens to get fresh, local produce. Others create non-toxic cleaners from natural ingredients to avoid harmful chemicals. Some even choose sustainable materials like bamboo or reclaimed wood to build their homes. But there are two non-negotiable actions you can start doing today to live sustainably at home: reducing your energy consumption and conserving water. We often think we've done all we can to save energy, but there are still a few simple, effective habits that many people haven't tried yet: Use LED light bulbs: Switching to energy-saving light bulbs is a simple way to save money and lower your energy use, as they consume less power and last longer than traditional bulbs. And yes, LED bulbs are great and all, but don't forget to turn off your lights when you leave the room! Unplug electronics when not in use: I know it's convenient to leave some electronics plugged in and ready to use. I've been guilty of this too. But then I discovered that some devices and appliances, often called 'energy vampires,' can continue draining power even when switched off. So, remember to unplug them when not in use to reduce energy costs! Use energy-efficient appliances: When your old appliances need replacement, look for energy-efficient alternatives. Modern energy-efficient appliances not only will cut down on your energy usage but will also save you money in the long run. Use natural light: Taking advantage of the beautiful natural light the sun provides each day is the best way to conserve energy at home and boost your mood! Use renewable energy sources: If your budget and climate allow, you could install solar panels on your rooftop to generate green electricity and reduce your dependence on fossil fuels. We know this may not be possible for most of us right now, so another option is to switch to an energy provider that offers green energy from renewable energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines. Now that we've learned how to make our houses more energy-efficient, let\u2019s turn our attention to another simple yet effective way to be more eco-friendly at home: conserving water.  Take short showers: Include shorter showers on your checklist for a more sustainable lifestyle. I know we all love long, relaxing showers, but that doesn't mean we should take long showers every day. Here's what I do: I keep my showers short by listening to two of my favorite songs. I promise this tip will help you lift your mood, get ready in under six minutes, and conserve water! Turn off the tap: Every time you wash your dishes, brush your teeth or shave, make sure to turn off the tap to save water. Install water-efficient fixtures: Another way to reduce your water usage is to install low-flow showerheads, dual-flush toilets, and faucet aerators. These upgrades will help you use less water without affecting your daily activities. Use appliances efficiently: Pay special attention to your dishwasher and washing machine, as these can waste a lot of water and energy. The most effective way to use them is to run only full loads, which helps you conserve both water and energy. While a sustainable home is important, our environmental impact goes beyond our walls. How we travel and get around can make a big difference. Let\u2019s look into how we can live more sustainably!  We can\u2019t ignore the environmental impact of our choices. We\u2019d all love to move around on renewable energy. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not the case yet. Most of our transportation options are still on gasoline, diesel or natural gas, all of which emit carbon. And we know how those greenhouse gases affect our planet. Try these simple tips to make your mobility more sustainable: Walk or bike when possible: Heading somewhere nearby? Leave your car at home and walk or bike instead. Enjoy the health benefits, get some fresh air and help a healthier planet all at once. Use public transport: If your area has reliable public transport options, use them occasionally to save on gas, skip the stress of driving and help a greener planet. Give carpooling or ride-sharing services a try: There are so many cars on the road with just one person inside. And many of them are going to the same place. By carpooling you not only take one car off the road but also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Fly less: Want to be a sustainable tourist? Take the train instead of flying when possible and look for eco-friendly hotels. If you can't skip flying, consider offsetting your carbon emissions. You made it! Now you know how to shop, eat and move sustainably and create a more eco-friendly home! But don\u2019t forget you don\u2019t live alone in this world. If we really want to have a more sustainable future, we must all be part of the solution. And that means we must encourage people, companies and governments to be more sustainable.  Even though our individual actions are important, they must be part of a broader strategy that includes educating others and holding corporations accountable for their environmental impact. Our actions do affect the environment, but the biggest environmental impacts come from large corporations. In fact, more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions have been produced by just 100 companies since 1988. And yet, the responsibility is disproportionately placed on individuals. \"Reduce your carbon footprint\" is a phrase we often hear. But wouldn't it be great if these major corporations did the same? To make a real difference, we need to advocate for systemic change. So, let's see how we can promote collective action and ensure companies are held responsible for their actions: Vote with your wallet: As a consumer you have a voice. Make sure to support companies that are transparent about their practices and avoid those that put profit over the planet and their workers. Demand Accountability: Get companies to be more responsible and sustainable. Reach out to them on social media, email or public forums and ask about their environmental impact and policies. Educate others: Share your knowledge with family and friends to promote sustainable lifestyles. If more people are aware of the issue, we can join forces to reduce our environmental impact, hold unethical companies accountable, and demand change. Promote Legislation: Support politicians who put the environment first and advocate for laws that make companies adhere to strict sustainability standards. Living sustainably is easier said than done, but that doesn't mean it is impossible. We often overwhelm ourselves trying to implement all the sustainable living tips we learn at once. However, the best approach is to choose a few simple actions you can easily incorporate into your everyday life and go from there. You don't need to be perfect to live a more sustainable lifestyle. There isn't a standardized path to sustainable living. We can all make a difference with our actions, whether it's reducing waste, conserving natural resources, saving energy, or boycotting unethical companies. Together, our collective efforts and pressure on companies can drive meaningful change, making sustainability the norm. It's all about putting a few tips into practice, discovering what works best for you, continuing to learn about sustainability, improving along the way, educating others, and advocating for systemic change! Sustainable living means reducing your own or society\u2019s use of natural resources and personal resources. It\u2019s about making conscious choices to minimize your impact on the environment by reducing waste, conserving energy and choosing sustainable products. It\u2019s about finding a balance between meeting current needs and preserving the planet for future generations A sustainable lifestyle is a way of living that puts ecological balance and social responsibility first. It\u2019s about habits and choices that contribute to conservation of the environment like using renewable energy, reducing waste and ethical consumerism. This lifestyle is derived from the broader concept of sustainable development which means meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Living sustainably means making daily choices that benefit the planet and society. This means using less energy, reducing waste through recycling and composting and choosing products that are eco friendly. It also means supporting local economies and being aware of the social impact of your actions so we can live in harmony with nature. Sustainable living can look like living in energy efficient homes, using public transport or cycling instead of driving, eating locally sourced organic food and participating in community initiatives that promote sustainability. It means integrating eco friendly practices into daily life to reduce environmental impact and improve personal and community health. Yes, sustainable living can be achievable when individuals and communities make incremental changes towards more sustainable practices. There are challenges like economic constraints and societal habits but many examples show that adopting sustainable practices can lead to positive environmental and social outcomes. By focusing on achievable goals and community support sustainable living becomes more accessible and doable. If you're motivated to reduce your impact on our planet, learning what it means to live sustainably is the first step in the right direction. With the rise of social media and the increasing availability of eco-friendly products, sustainable living has become more popular than ever. Yet, sustainable lifestyle is a broad term. While we often see influencers sharing their aesthetically pleasing zero-waste lives, sustainable living can actually look different for everyone. When I first heard about sustainable living, I thought I needed to buy all the trendy 'zero waste' products and drastically change my lifestyle. But it doesn't have to be that way. That mindset can, in fact, hold you back from starting a sustainable lifestyle or make the journey more challenging. That's why we've created this comprehensive guide to help you understand what sustainable living is and how you can easily live sustainably without feeling frustrated. So, let's get started! Sustainable living is all about reducing the impact of our lifestyle choices on the environment and being socially responsible. In other words, living sustainably is not just about the environment but also about fairness and a better life for all. This can include reducing the use of Earth's natural resources, choosing products made under fair conditions, cutting down on plastic waste, reducing your carbon footprint, minimizing food waste, etc. Now I know what sustainable living means I take a more holistic approach to my life, I prioritize the environment, my health, and others. But to stay motivated in the long run and never lose focus it\u2019s also important to know why these sustainable lifestyle choices matter to you, society, and the planet as a whole. Sustainable living has three main pillars, often referred to as the \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d or the \u201c3 Ps\u201d: People, Planet, and Profit. Getting these pillars right is key to a truly sustainable life and society. The \u201cPeople\u201d pillar is about social equity and fair treatment for all. This means: Fair work practices and conditions Education and healthcare Community development and support Cultural preservation and diversity Human rights and social justice In reality this might mean supporting businesses with ethical labour practices, volunteering in your community or advocating for policies that promote social equity. The \u201cPlanet\u201d pillar is about protecting and preserving our natural world. This means: Reducing carbon emissions and climate change Conserving natural resources and biodiversity Minimising pollution and waste Protecting ecosystems and wildlife habitats Promoting renewable energy and sustainable agriculture Implementing this pillar might mean eating a plant based diet, using renewable energy or getting involved in local conservation efforts. The \u201cProfit\u201d pillar acknowledges the need for economic sustainability. It\u2019s about making sustainable practices economically viable in the long term. This means: Creating sustainable business models Promoting circular economy principles Investing in green technologies and innovations Balancing economic growth with environmental and social responsibility Encouraging responsible consumption and production On an individual level this might mean supporting sustainable businesses, investing in ethical funds or choosing products with a lower environmental impact even if they cost a bit more. The secret to sustainable living is to balance these three pillars. Every decision we make - from the products we buy to the policies we support - should ideally consider all three: Is it socially equitable? (People) Is it environmentally friendly? (Planet) Is it economically viable? (Profit) It\u2019s not about being perfect, just making choices that balance these three pillars as best we can. Every little helps. Living sustainably allows us to be a force for good and improve our quality of life. Besides making us feel good about our lifestyle choices, living sustainably has many benefits for our health, our finances, our planet and everyone who lives on it. By reducing the environmental impact of our actions and supporting fair practices we help create a better world for all living things and future generations. Let\u2019s see the environmental, economic and social benefits of living sustainably: Environmental protection: Sustainable practices help you protect ecosystems, preserve natural resources, promote biodiversity, fight climate change, prevent pollution, reduce waste and more. Healthy habits: Living sustainably can help you make healthier food choices, reduce your exposure to toxic chemicals, get more physical activity with eco-friendly transport options, feel more purpose and fulfilled. Reduced expenses: Sustainability is also a smart financial move. Sustainable practices can lower your utility bills, save you money in the long run and cut costs on disposable items, fuel and overall consumption. Social connections: A sustainable lifestyle can also help you meet like-minded people, share similar experiences and build meaningful relationships. Fair labor standards: Choosing products made fairly means a system where workers are paid fairly, work in safe conditions and are treated with respect. Future security: The choices we make today will pave the way for a sustainable future so that future generations have access to the same resources we do today. Now that you know what sustainable living is and why it's important, it's time to show you a cheat sheet that will make making sustainably-minded decisions a breeze! The 7 Rs of sustainable living are a set of principles that are essential for a more sustainable lifestyle: Refuse: Avoid buying or acquiring unnecessary items that will go to waste. Rethink: Reflect on your choices and look for more sustainable alternatives. Reduce: Cut down on your consumption of new stuff, especially disposable items. Reuse: Find creative ways to use items multiple times before discarding them. Repair: Fix broken or damaged items instead of throwing them away. Recycle: Collect your recyclables and take them to the nearest recycling facility. Rot (Compost): Turn organic waste into nutrient-rich soil for your garden. If this list feels like too much info, you can stick to the basic 3 Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. Once you've started to implement these basic rules, the rest will be easier to remember! We know that learning how to live sustainably can be overwhelming at first, so we want to make it easier and more enjoyable for you. That's why we've compiled simple yet impactful tips that will level up your sustainability game from zero to eco-warrior! Every decision we make has an indirect impact\u2014positive or negative\u2014on the environment and society. To live a more sustainable lifestyle, we have to reflect on our lifestyle choices so we can boost our positive impact and cut down on the negative. Small changes in our everyday life\u2014like how we move, the food we eat, the amount of water we use, the products we choose to buy, and even the candidates we support\u2014can have a significant impact. Looking to live a more sustainable lifestyle? Try starting with these easy changes: Changing our consumption patterns is probably the most challenging part of starting a sustainable lifestyle. And it becomes even harder when our economic system keeps promoting consumerism. We're constantly encouraged to buy the latest products, but this habit is highly detrimental to the environment. And let's be honest, we don\u2019t need much to be happy. Here are a few simple ways to be a conscious consumer: Adopt a minimalist approach: Before buying something ask yourself: Do I need this? How often will I use it? Can I borrow it from a friend? Don\u2019t let emotions get the better of you, take a few days to think about it. Remember emotions can trigger impulse buying so giving yourself time helps you make more thoughtful decisions. Opt for durable products: Investing in high quality, durable items will pay off in the long run. Products designed to last and can be repaired will reduce the need for replacements and help you reduce waste and save money. Support small, sustainable businesses: Large corporations often have a bigger impact on the environment and their workers. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to support businesses that actually invest in sustainability and avoid those that don\u2019t. Believe it or not this puts more pressure on big corporations and forces them to do better. Avoid single-use products: Replacing disposable products like plastic water bottles, plastic bags and paper towels with reusable alternatives like reusable bags, beeswax wraps and a reusable water bottle is an easy way to live sustainably. We need to be mindful of our consumption habits to preserve resources. And we need to be especially careful about buying new clothes. Luckily there\u2019s ways to support sustainable fashion: Avoid Fast Fashion: Fast fashion is responsible for about 10% of global carbon emissions. If you want to reduce your contribution to climate change, you should avoid trendy clothing that's designed for short-term use. Want to learn how to have a climate-friendly wardrobe?

A 2022 study suggests that certain dishwasher detergent ingredients\u2014particularly alcohol ethoxylates found in many rinse aids\u2014could damage the gut barrier and potentially contribute to \u201cleaky gut\u201d syndrome. Plus, many can damage aquatic life when they wash down the drain. It\u2019s even more concerning that these detergents can leave residues on your dishes, meaning you might end up ingesting them along with your food. On the other hand, natural dishwasher detergents use gentle yet effective ingredients to tackle grease and food residue. Many also come in eco-friendly packaging\u2014perfect for anyone trying to reduce plastic waste and support sustainable lifestyle. In this article, I\u2019m excited to share my carefully curated list of the top non-toxic dish detergents we\u2019ve researched as a team of three and tested\u2014including liquids, powders, tablets, sheets, and pods\u2014so you can find the ideal match for your non-toxic lifestyle and cleaner home. By the end, you\u2019ll have a crystal-clear understanding of how to make your dishwashing routine healthier for you, your loved ones, and the environment. Ready to discover a safer, greener way to get spotless dishes? Let\u2019s dive in.  When I first started researching dish detergents, I was shocked by the number of harsh chemicals that go into conventional products. Here\u2019s what I found: Most conventional dishwashing detergents rely on ingredients like triclosan, sodium laureth sulfate, formaldehyde-releasing agents, synthetic preservatives, phosphates, unnecessary dyes and fragrances, and more. These chemicals can irritate your skin, threaten marine life, and may even increase cancer risks with repeated exposure. \u2022 Formaldehyde-Releasing Agents can cause everything from nausea to respiratory issues. \u2022 Phosphates pollute water bodies and reduce biodiversity. \u2022 Ethoxylated ingredients (like sodium laureth sulfate and PEGs) may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, a possible carcinogen. You might think you\u2019re safe because you\u2019re not rubbing these chemicals directly on your hands, but here\u2019s the catch: \u2022 Spillage and accidental contact can cause skin irritation \u2022 Inhaling detergent powders or aerosols may lead to conditions like reactive airway disease (a type of asthma). A health risk assessment reported a case where an individual developed reactive airway disease (an asthma-like condition) immediately after shaking a detergent powder package! \u2022 Chemical residues can remain on dishes, meaning you could ingest small amounts over time. And what about the environmental effects? Many traditional detergents don\u2019t biodegrade well, leading to long-term damage in aquatic ecosystems. That\u2019s why choosing bio degradable, non toxic detergents or diy natural cleaners is a big win for both your health and the planet. Thankfully, you can switch to non toxic alternatives to protect your health and the environment!  \"Best\" \"Better\"  When we set out to find the best non-toxic dish detergent, we started by looking at the ingredients. Are they genuinely safe\u2014or do they hide harsh chemicals? We combed through countless labels to ensure that every product we recommend is free from harmful or questionable additives. Certifications do matter, but for us, confirming that a detergent\u2019s ingredients are truly clean comes first. We also paid close attention to sustainability\u2014does the brand use recyclable, compostable, or plastic-free packaging when possible? Finally, we tested these detergents ourselves and consulted real-world reviews to confirm they aren\u2019t just safer, but that they also get the job done. After all, a detergent has to work well to earn a place on your kitchen shelf. To simplify your choice, we divided our top picks into two categories: \"Best\" Natural Dishwasher Detergents: These products rely on natural or organic ingredients and skip common irritants like synthetic fragrances, PEGs, and harsh preservatives. They also come in sustainable packaging and steer clear of chemicals that harm aquatic life or contribute to plastic pollution. If you want the purest dishwashing detergent possible, these options are for you. \"Better\" Non Toxic Dishwasher Detergents: These detergents still use cleaner ingredients than conventional ones but may contain a few chemicals with minor environmental or sensitivity concerns. Because these additives mainly pose risks with direct skin contact, their presence in a dishwasher setting is less worrisome. Think of these as a more practical middle ground between ultra-clean formulas and standard store-bought detergents. So, without further ado, let's check the best non toxic dish detergent! \"BEST\" Certifications: EPA Safer Choice, EWG Verified, Cradle to Cradle Certified\u2122, USDA BioPreferred, Leaping Bunny, B Corp, Climate Neutral. EWG Score: EWG Verified mark Packaging: Paper, Paper-Based Tape, Water-Based Inks Price: $21 for 60 tablets Why We Like It: You won\u2019t find harsh chemicals or plastic in Blueland\u2019s dishwasher tabs.

Because it\u2019s fragrance-free, it\u2019s gentle on your skin, and a little goes a long way\u2014just follow the brand\u2019s suggested dilution for each cleaning job. Shop Branch Basics here*  Image @ Branch Basics Certifications: Leaping Bunny EWG Score: A (Low Concern) Packaging: Paper Price: $22.99 for 37.5 Oz Why We Like It: If you prefer a no-fuss powder, Earthley Wellness delivers natural cleaning power using just a few simple ingredients\u2014think baking soda and citric acid. You only need one tablespoon per load, and the light citrus scent freshens up your kitchen. When I first tried this non toxic dishwashing detergent, I couldn't believe how it easily tackled tough grease on my pans. You\u2019ll especially appreciate how it cuts through tough grease without soaking! The only downside is that it can leave a white film on dishes in harder water, but a splash of white vinegar in your rinse aid compartment usually does the trick. Shop Earthley Wellness here*  Image @ Earthley Certifications: Leaping Bunny, Carbon Neutral EWG Score: B (Low Concern) Packaging: Recycled cardboard Price: $15 for 25 tablets Why We Like It: If you\u2019re watching your budget but still want a non-toxic and eco-friendly dishwasher detergent option, Ecover tablets are a solid pick! You'll love Ecover's eco-friendly dishwasher tabs also for their cleaning power ! The brand uses sodium carbonate and sodium carbonate peroxide to handle stubborn food particles and residues like dried-on foods like egg ortea stains. You can skip pre-rinsing and additional rinse aid\u2014these tablets handle it all! The recycled cardboard packaging also helps you cut back on plastic waste. Shop Ecover here*  Image @ Ecover \"BETTER\" Certifications: Leaping Bunny, EPA Safer Choice, Women Owned EWG Score: A (Low Concern) Packaging: Recyclable plastic bottle Price: $15.61 for 40 Fl Oz Why We Like It: If you prefer liquid over tabs or powder, Ecos offers a gentler formula that still cuts through everyday grime. This was one of the first eco-friendly detergents I tried, and I found it comparable to typical store brands in cleaning power. If you\u2019re dealing with especially greasy dishes, you may want to add a bit more product for best results. Why Better: Although it\u2019s relatively safe, Ecos contains Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, which might affect aquatic life, and Potassium Sorbate, a synthetic preservative that could irritate very sensitive skin. Shop Ecos here*  Image @ Ecos Certifications: Leaping Bunny, PETA cruelty-free EWG Score: No information. Packaging: Plastic Price: $18.89 for 50 dishwashing pods Why We Like It: If you want a pre-measured, easy-to-use option, Puracy Pods are hard to beat. They\u2019re unscented, so you won\u2019t get that lingering chemical smell on your dishes. The formula is also septic-safe, and I\u2019ve recommended it to friends with septic systems who report zero issues. It\u2019s pretty versatile too, working nicely in both hard and soft water. Why Better: While these dishwasher detergent pods are free of phosphates, SLES, parabens, chlorine bleach, petrochemicals, and phthalates, they contain Sodium Metasilicate\u2014an ingredient that may be harmful to aquatic life. And like all dishwasher detergent pods, they contain poly vinyl alcohol (PVA), a water soluble film that may not fully biodegrade in the environment. Shop Puracy here*  Image @ Puracy Certifications: Leaping Bunny EWG Score: No information Packaging: Plastic Price: $33.24 for 120 pods Why We Like It: Molly\u2019s Suds are a lifesaver if you can\u2019t stand spots or streaks on your dishes. Despite the higher price tag, these fragrance-free pods excel at leaving glassware crystal clear and your dishwasher free of build-up. After using them for a few months, I can also guarantee that these fragrance free dishwasher pods won't leave any residue on your dishwasher either. However, I\u2019ve noticed that these dishwasher pods aren\u2019t always effective on very greasy pans. Why Better: They\u2019re ethoxylate-free, phosphate-free, and chlorine-free, but do contain Sodium Silicate and Itaconic Acid/Sulfonate Copolymer\u2014potential irritants that can persist in the environment. The PVOH film can also contribute to microplastic pollution if it doesn\u2019t degrade fully. Shop Mollys Suds here*  Image @ Molly Suds Certifications: N/A EWG Score: No information Packaging: Cardboard Price: $15 for 30 sheets Why We Like It: If you travel frequently or have limited storage space, you should try Gull Living non toxic dishwasher detergent. Thanks to their compact and lightweight design, these detergent sheets can help you save space under your sink while leaving your dishes clean and fresh. What I like the most about this non toxic dishwashing detergent is its price and durability. Gull Living detergent packs come with 30 sheets and you only need half a sheet to handle a regular wash cycle. This means you can tackle up to 60 regular loads for just $15! However, you may need to pre-rinse or use one sheet to handle heavily greasy items or tough, dried-on foods. Why Better: Like many pods and sheets, they use polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) that might not fully biodegrade. For more information in this topic, please read our article on deterget sheets. They also contain Mono-C12-14-Alkyl Esters, which can irritate skin and linger in waterways. Shop Gull Living here*  Image @ Gull Living Even though plenty of truly non-toxic dishwasher detergents exist\u2014like the ones w\u2019ve recommended above\u2014not every \u201cclean\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d label tells the whole story. In our reasearch, we discovered many products claiming to be non-toxic yet hiding harsh chemicals that can threaten both your health and the environment. Here are some examples of 'non toxic' dish detergents we do not recommend: Certifications: N/A EWG Score: No information Packaging: Plastic Why We Don't Recommend: We've seen many people recommending Truly Free dish soap as a non toxic and eco-friendly option. Truly Free also markets itself as eco-friendly. While this dishwasher soap may be better than most conventional dishwasher products, it contains Sodium Polyacrylate, a synthetic polymer that can release microplastics and harm aquatic life if used in large quantities. Certifications: N/A EWG Score: No information Packaging: Pouch made from 35% post consumer recycled materials Why We Don't Recommend: Clean People dishwasher detergent pods aren't as eco-friendly and clean as advertised. Despite claims of \u201cclean ingredients,\u201d Clean People pods include Sodium Metasilicate, which can irritate or burn skin, plus TAED (Tetraacetylethylenediamine) and Itaconic Acid, Sodium Salt, both of which may harm aquatic organisms and disrupt beneficial microbial communities at high concentrations. Certifications: B Corp, Leaping Bunny, USDA BioPreferred, EPA Safer Choice EWG Score: No information Packaging: 90% plastic-free packaging Why We Don't Recommend: Seventh Generation is known for eco-friendly branding, but some of its detergents have C12-14 Alcohols Ethoxylated Propoxylated, potentially contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, a suspected carcinogen. There\u2019s also Sodium Silicate, which can irritate skin and harm the environment. Certifications: N/A EWG Score: No information Packaging: Recyclable cardboard container Why We Don't Recommend: Another cleaning product we cannot recommend is Dirty Labs' Bio Enzyme Dishwasher Detergent. Dirty Labs\u2019 Bio Enzyme formula contains Hydrous Sodium Silicate Powder (a highly alkaline irritant) and Silicon Dioxide, which can cause respiratory problems if inhaled in powdered form. These ingredients may also disrupt aquatic ecosystems. Not sure how to spot toxic detergents? Let's explore how to tell if your dish soap is non-toxic Switching to a safer product can drastically reduce these risks. In my home, I noticed fewer mystery sniffles, plus a stronger sense of responsibility toward our environment. Here\u2019s why going non-toxic makes a big difference: Healthier for You and Your Family: Fewer synthetic chemicals on your plates means fewer toxins in your body\u2014especially crucial if you have kids or chemical sensitivities. Eco-Friendly: Many non-toxic detergents biodegrade naturally, helping protect water sources and marine life. Gentler on Skin: Without harsh preservatives or fragrances, you\u2019re less likely to experience dryness or rashes. Sustainable Packaging & Manufacturing: Several brands opt for renewable energy in production or minimal-waste packaging. Cost-Effective: Many eco-friendly detergents are concentrated, so they can stretch further than conventional ones. Protection from Emerging Health Concerns: Recent studies hint at gut barrier damage from chemicals like alcohol ethoxylates. Going toxin-free helps you sidestep such hidden risks. The quickest way to find out is by checking the ingredient list. If you\u2019re not a chemist (no worries, most of us aren\u2019t!), use the quick cheat sheet below to identify the biggest red flags. If any of these show up, you\u2019re better off choosing something else. Dyes \u2013 Artificial colors used in detergents that act as endocrine disruptors. Phthalates (i.e. Diethyl Phthalate) \u2013 Endocrine disruptors, often hidden under the term 'Fragrance'. Fragrance \u2013 Companies aren\u2019t required to disclose the specific chemicals used in their fragrances. Triclosan \u2013 An antibacterial and antifungal agent that acts as an endocrine disruptor. Formaldehyde Releasers \u2013 Like DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, sodium hydroxymethylglycinate, formalin, and imidazolidinyl urea, linked to cancer and allergic reactions. Ethoxylated ingredients \u2013 Like sodium laureth sulfate, PEGs, Polysorbate-20, alcohol ethoxylates, ethylene glycol, and anything ending in -eth, like Ceteareth-20. The chemicals may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, a chemical linked to cancer. Phosphates \u2013 Chemicals that pollute water bodies. Sodium Hypochlorite \u2013 A strong bleach that can cause irritation, allergies, and respiratory issues. Polyacrylates \u2013 Like acrylic acid, sodium polyacrylate and acrylamide, these ingredients are persistent in the environment. Benzisothiazolinone & Methylisothiazolinone \u2013 Preservatives that can cause allergic reactions and skin irritation, and are highly toxic to aquatic life.  Now that you know what ingredients to avoid, you can learn how to choose truly eco-friendly and non-toxic cleaning products for your home. To make sure you're investing in a truly non-toxic and eco-friendly dishwasher detergent, consider the following: Packaging: Consider refills or bulk options to cut down on plastic. Some brands offer compostable sustainable materials or recycled packaging. Avoid plastic packaging whenever possible. Certifications: Look for third-party certifications to verify a company's claims, such as Made Safe, EWG Verified, EPA Safer Choice, USDA BioPreferred, Leaping Bunny, PETA, and B Corp. Keep in mind that while rigorous, certifications are not always infallible. Make sure to also check the brand\u2019s commitment to sustainable practices and their products' ingredient lists. Natural ingredients: Opt for plant-based, biodegradable formulas made of safe and natural ingredients, such as citric acid, sodium carbonate, sodium carbonate peroxide, sodium citrate, baking soda, sodium sulfate, and decyl glucoside. While researching, I realized not everyone knows there\u2019s a big difference between products made for dishwashers and those meant for your sink. I learned this the hard way when I accidentally used hand dish soap in my machine\u2014bubbles everywhere! Dishwasher Detergents: Formulated for high temperatures and intense mechanical action. They\u2019re typically low-sudsing (too much foam can mess with machine cleaning). Hand Dish Soaps: Gentler formulas designed for a foamy, manual scrub. Even if they\u2019re labeled \u201cnatural,\u201d they\u2019re usually not suitable for dishwasher use. So if you\u2019re aiming for non-toxic, make sure you pick a formula specifically created for your type of dishwashing. If you have \u201chard water\u201d\u2014like I do\u2014mineral deposits can leave annoying spots on glassware or utensils. Thankfully, non-toxic detergents often contain sodium-based ingredients to tackle these minerals. Look for sodium carbonate or sodium citrate in the ingredient list. They bind calcium and magnesium ions so you can rinse them away instead of letting them cling to your dishes. Ditch Hidden Toxins: Conventional dishwasher detergents contain harmful chemicals, like benzisothiazolinone and formaldehyde-releasers. Non toxic dishwashing detergents help you protect your health, your family, and the environment while keeping your dishes spot free. Beware of Greenwashing: Always look beyond the promises on the label. Check the ingredient lists of your cleaning products to make sure they're completely clean and non toxic. Choose Wisely: Not all detergents are created equal. When choosing the best non toxic dish detergent, consider your water hardness level, dishwasher compatibility, and personal preferences. Prefer Biodegradable Options: While pods and sheets are convenient, they contain non-biodegradable synthetic ingredients like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Even though PVA is water-soluble, it may not fully degrade, potentially contributing to microplastic pollution.  Check the ingredient list for toxic chemicals like phosphates, synthetic fragrances, dyes, and formaldehyde-releasing agents. Look for certifications such as EWG Verified, MADE SAFE or EPA Safer Choice Conventional dishwasher detergents can leave chemical residues on dishes, which may be ingested and pose health risks such as allergies or gut barrier damage. Non-toxic alternatives avoid these risks by using safer, biodegradable ingredients. Yes, modern non-toxic dishwasher pods are effective at cleaning dishes, utilizing plant-based surfactants and enzymes to tackle grease and stains without harsh chemicals Many conventional dishwasher detergents contain harmful chemicals like alcohol ethoxylates, phosphates, and synthetic fragrances, which can irritate skin, harm aquatic life, and leave residues on dishes Cascade detergents often contain phosphates, alcohol ethoxylates, and sodium silicate, which can irritate skin and harm the environmen Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only.

Shop Public Goods here*  Image @ Public Goods These are our top picks for non-toxic dish soaps. Whether we need something tough on grease or gentle on our hands, these options have us covered. And while non toxic soaps are the best options for health and safety, expectations around efficacy are important to mention. Plus, many brands do a really impressive job of keeping their ingredients list clean and tight, free from toxic stuff, but there's still a lot of deception out there. It's important to equip yourself with the knowledge you need to navigate the unavoidable greenwashing that takes place in this industry.  There\u2019s one thing we know for sure: if we use truly non-toxic dish soaps, we are saving ourselves and our families from exposure to some really dangerous chemicals. But, there\u2019s something we noticed during our testing phase that\u2019s worth mentioning. With many of the gentler, non-toxic options, you might find yourself using a little more product to get that squeaky clean feel. It\u2019s a small trade-off, but one that\u2019s totally worth it for the peace of mind that comes with knowing you\u2019re using something safe. When it comes to choosing the best non-toxic dish soap, knowing which ingredients to avoid can make all the difference. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of the common culprits we sniffed out in conventional dish soaps: Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES): These synthetic surfactants create that rich lather we\u2019re used to, but they can be harsh on the skin, causing irritation and dryness. SLES is also often contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, a potential carcinogen. Phthalates: Often hidden under the term \"fragrance,\" phthalates are used to make scents last longer. They\u2019re known to be endocrine disruptors, meaning they can interfere with hormone function and potentially lead to health issues over time. Triclosan: This antibacterial agent was once popular in many household products but has been linked to hormone disruption and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. It\u2019s also harmful to aquatic ecosystems. Parabens: These preservatives are used to extend shelf life, but they\u2019re also hormone disruptors that can mimic estrogen in the body, potentially leading to reproductive issues and an increased risk of cancer. Synthetic Fragrances: The term \"fragrance\" on a label can hide a cocktail of chemicals, many of which can trigger allergies, skin irritation, and even respiratory issues. Some synthetic fragrances also contain phthalates. DEA/MEA/TEA (Diethanolamine, Monoethanolamine, Triethanolamine): These chemicals are used as foaming agents and emulsifiers but can react with other ingredients to form nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic. They can also cause skin and eye irritation. Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde-Releasing Preservatives: Often used to prevent bacterial growth, formaldehyde is a known carcinogen and can cause respiratory issues and skin irritation. Look for names like DMDM hydantoin, imidazolidinyl urea, and quaternium-15 on labels. Chlorine: While effective at killing bacteria, chlorine is a harsh chemical that can irritate the skin, eyes, and respiratory system. It\u2019s also harmful to the environment, particularly aquatic life. Artificial Colors: These dyes are used to make products look more appealing, but they offer no cleaning benefits and can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. Some artificial colors are also linked to more serious health concerns like hyperactivity and cancer.  \"But I rinse the soap off my dishes, so it\u2019s fine, right?\" Not quite. Just because the soap gets rinsed away doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re completely in the clear. For starters, when you\u2019re washing dishes, the soap is in constant contact with your hands, and those harmful ingredients can be absorbed through your skin. Over time, this exposure adds up, potentially leading to skin irritation, hormonal imbalances, and other health concerns. And even after you\u2019ve rinsed the dishes, there\u2019s often a residue left behind. You might not see it, but it's there. This residue can bind to the food you eat, meaning those chemicals could end up in your body, where they can cause even more harm. So, while it might seem like a small thing, the ingredients in your dish soap can have a big impact on your health and well-being. That\u2019s why choosing a truly non-toxic option isn\u2019t just a nice-to-have\u2014it\u2019s a must for a safer, healthier kitchen. Here\u2019s the hard truth: not everything that claims to be \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cgreen\u201d actually is. The dish soap industry is notorious for greenwashing\u2014using misleading labels and logos to make products seem safer than they really are. You\u2019ve probably noticed this in the food industry with terms like \u201cnatural flavor\u201d on labels, which can hide a wide range of ingredients. The same trick applies to dish soaps, where terms like \u201cfragrance,\u201d \u201cparfum,\u201d or \u201cperfume\u201d are used to mask potentially harmful chemicals. What makes it even trickier is that companies aren\u2019t required to disclose the actual ingredients that make up these fragrances. This means that a seemingly simple word like \u201cfragrance\u201d could be hiding a cocktail of chemicals, including phthalates (linked to hormone disruption),\u00a0parabens (which have been associated with reproductive harm), and synthetic musks(which can accumulate in the body and the environment). These ingredients are often used to enhance the scent, prolong shelf life, or even just improve the product's texture or appearance, but they come with risks that aren\u2019t immediately obvious from the label. The bottom line? You can\u2019t rely on pretty packaging or vague claims to ensure you\u2019re buying something safe. It all comes down to reading the ingredient list carefully. If you see broad, non-specific terms like \u201cfragrance,\u201d \"perfume,\" or \u201cparfum,\u201d be cautious. These terms can mask a host of hidden ingredients that could be anything but natural or safe. By equipping yourself with the right information, you can avoid falling for these greenwashing tactics and choose products that genuinely align with your commitment to a healthier, safer home. It\u2019s not just about what\u2019s in the bottle\u2014it\u2019s about what\u2019s not, too. Finding truly non-toxic products can feel like navigating a minefield. With so many brands using terms like \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201ceco-friendly,\u201d it\u2019s easy to be misled. We just can\u2019t afford to take labels at face value.  That\u2019s why we dig deep into the ingredients before making our choices. Here are some brands that might look green on the outside but don\u2019t quite live up to the hype: Clean Cult* With a name like Clean Cult, you\u2019d expect nothing but purity. However, their dish soap contains Laureth-7, a synthetic surfactant that can be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, a possible carcinogen. It\u2019s a perfect example of why we don\u2019t just trust the label\u2014we read the fine print. Truly Free Dish Soap* Despite the promise in its name, Truly Free isn\u2019t free from questionable ingredients. Sodium Benzoate is one of them\u2014a preservative that, under certain conditions, can release benzene, a known carcinogen. This is a prime example of why we always double-check what\u2019s really inside. Ecover* Ecover is often marketed as a green alternative, but their dish soap contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS). SLS is a powerful surfactant that can strip skin of moisture, causing irritation, and is harmful to aquatic life. It\u2019s a reminder that even \u201cgreen\u201d brands aren\u2019t always as gentle as they seem. Method* Method is a favorite for many looking to clean greener, but their dish soaps contain SLS, Methylisothiazolinone (MIT), dyes, fragrance, and Octylisothiazolinone. These ingredients can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions, not to mention their environmental impact. This is why we always look beyond the branding to the ingredient list. Mrs. Meyers*  Mrs. Meyers is another brand that\u2019s built a reputation for being natural and gentle. But their dish soaps include SLS, polysorbates, fragrance, MIT, and Benzisothiazolinone (BIT). These are all ingredients we steer clear of because of their potential to irritate skin and harm the environment. Seventh Generation* Known for their eco-friendly image, Seventh Generation\u2019s dish soaps contain SLS, MIT, and BIT. While they may market themselves as safer for the planet, these ingredients tell a different story. Navigating the world of \u201cgreen\u201d products can be tricky, but it\u2019s worth the effort. These examples show just how much research goes into our decision-making process. We\u2019re not just looking for products that claim to be non-toxic; we\u2019re making sure they actually live up to that promise. By being vigilant and informed, we can avoid the pitfalls of greenwashing and choose products that truly support a healthier lifestyle and a safer environment.\u00a0 Conventional dish soaps often contain harmful chemicals like SLS, phthalates, and parabens, which can cause skin irritation and disrupt hormones. Non-toxic dish soaps are made with safe, natural ingredients such as organic oils and plant-based extracts, offering effective cleaning while protecting your health and the environment. Some brands claim to be \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201ceco-friendly\u201d but still contain toxic ingredients. Always check the ingredient list to ensure you're choosing a truly non-toxic option. Look for certifications like MadeSafe, EWG Verified, Leaping Bunny, and Ecocert. These labels guarantee that the product has been thoroughly vetted for safety, sustainability, and ethical sourcing, ensuring you're truly getting a non-toxic and eco-friendly dish soap. Switch to non-toxic dish soaps to reduce exposure to harmful chemicals, enjoy a safer kitchen, and support a healthier environment. If you enjoyed this post, check out this other article on a safe and non toxic products: DIY Non Toxic Cleaner The safest dish soaps are those free from harmful chemicals like SLS, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances. Look for products with certifications like MadeSafe, EWG Verified, or Leaping Bunny. Brands like Meliora, Dr. Bronner\u2019s, and Sonett are excellent choices. No, Dawn contains SLS and synthetic fragrances, making it less safe compared to non-toxic alternatives. Dr. Bronner\u2019s Pure Castile Soap or Meliora\u2019s Dish Soap Puck are excellent natural alternatives to Dawn, made with safe, plant-based ingredients. Check out the other products on this list! They're all great alternatives. Check the ingredient list for harmful chemicals like SLS, parabens, and synthetic fragrances. Look for certifications like MadeSafe or EWG Verified to ensure safety. Avoid dish soaps containing Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), phthalates (often hidden under \"fragrance\"), parabens, triclosan, DEA/MEA/TEA, formaldehyde-releasing preservatives, chlorine, and artificial colors.

We may earn a commission on purchases, at no additional cost to you. Learn more \u2192 Welcome to a space where your health and your family\u2019s well-being take center stage. Just like swapping out toxic candles for clean ones or scrutinizing the lotions in your bathroom, your laundry routine also deserves a closer look. After all, freshly washed clothes shouldn\u2019t come at the cost of our health. As a mother and founder of a sustainability-focused company, I\u2019ve learned that no one will hand us good health on a silver platter\u2014it\u2019s a conscious choice we make every single day. And one of the simplest yet most impactful choices we can make is ditching conventional laundry detergents for gentle, eco-friendly, and DIY laundry detergent. If you\u2019re ready to keep your wardrobe (and your conscience) spotless, this guide is for you. Conventional detergents often contain harmful chemicals like phosphates, artificial fragrances, and harsh surfactants that can irritate skin, disrupt hormones, and pollute waterways. DIY laundry detergents let you control every ingredient, ensuring a safer and more affordable wash cycle. Plant-based, mineral-based, and fragrance-free options aren\u2019t just for \u201ccrunchy\u201d folks\u2014they\u2019re a wise choice for anyone looking to cut down on toxins in their home. Switching to DIY is about small steps: you don\u2019t have to be perfect, just intentional.  If you\u2019ve already done a big bathroom cabinet purge\u2014tossing toxic soaps, lotions, and mysterious potions\u2014making your own laundry detergent is a natural next step. Clothes come into direct contact with your skin all day long (and your kids\u2019 skin, too!). So it only makes sense to keep them free of chemicals that can cause everything from rashes to respiratory issues. Better for Health: No one wants nasty chemicals lingering on the fabrics that touch our skin\u2014especially if you have little ones, allergies, or sensitive skin. Kinder to the Planet: Conventional detergents often come ususally in plastic jugs and contain non-biodegradable ingredients that harm aquatic life. With a homemade recipe, you typically use simple, earth-friendly components and minimal packaging. Cost-Effective: Tally up the price of store-bought brands (especially the \u201cclean\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d ones), and you\u2019ll see how quickly it adds up. A DIY batch can be just pennies per load, a fraction of the price of commercial options. Customizable: Skip fragrances altogether or add essential oils you trust. You decide exactly what goes into your detergent\u2014no more surprise ingredients. It\u2019s hard to believe that something labeled \u201cfresh scent\u201d or \u201cclean breeze\u201d could actually be packed with questionable chemicals. But conventional detergents are often loaded with so many harsh chemicals, that can lead to skin irritation, eye irritation, and even hormone disruption. Fragrances often include chemicals that can disrupt hormones and cause health issues. While many safe ingredients are available, knowing what to avoid is equally important. Phosphates: Great for cleaning, bad for our waterways (they cause algae blooms that starve aquatic life of oxygen). Synthetic Fragrances: A laundry list of hidden chemicals that can trigger asthma, skin irritations, or hormonal imbalances. Optical Brighteners: They don\u2019t really clean clothes\u2014they just trick your eyes into thinking they\u2019re brighter. Plus, they can lead to skin sensitivity. Sulfates (SLS/SLES): These create foam but can dry out or irritate skin. It\u2019s no surprise that many people suffer from allergies or sensitivities without ever suspecting their detergent. Knowledge is power, so let\u2019s put the power back in your hands.  @ Pure Original Ingredients  Before we jump into recipes, let\u2019s introduce the MVPs of DIY laundry detergent. Most of these items are affordable, easy to find, and safe for you and Mother Earth. Baking Soda * is a staple, acting as a cleaning agent, deodorizer, and water softener, which enhances detergent performance. It also balances pH levels. Washing Soda * (Sodium Carbonate)  is another essential component, enhancing detergent effectiveness by breaking down stains and grease. Borax* (Optional) - A natural mineral that boosts cleaning power. If you prefer to skip it, up the baking soda or washing soda. Castile Soap * (Bar or Liquid) - Gentle, plant-based soap derived from olive oil (and sometimes coconut or hemp). It is a natural surfactant, cleans without the harsh chemicals found in commercial detergents. You can use either liquid castile soap or grated castile bar soap, depending on your preference and the type of detergent you\u2019re making. These ingredients are simple, non-toxic, and safe for both your family and the environment. Soap Nuts *(Soap Berries) - The ultimate \u201cback to nature\u201d approach, these berries release natural saponin when agitated in water. Essential Oils* (e.g., lavender, lemon, tea tree) - Optional for scent. Make sure to choose high-quality oils. White Vinegar* - Makes for an excellent natural fabric softener in the rinse cycle. No, your clothes won\u2019t smell like pickles! Pro Tip: Start with washing soda + baking soda + grated castile soap. That trio alone will give you a low-cost, gentle and effective detergent. If you have extremely hard water, consider occasionally using a water softener or adding a few tablespoons of vinegar or citric acid to the rinse cycle. This helps prevent residue or \u2018soap scum\u2019 from building up on clothes. Creating your own laundry detergent offers flexibility to avoid unnecessary additives. For instance, you can leave out fragrances, which are often made with harmful chemicals that can trigger allergies or skin sensitivities. The simplicity of homemade detergent and knowing exactly what\u2019s in it offers peace of mind.  Let\u2019s get started! Here are four simple DIY laundry detergent recipes: powdered, liquid, one for sensitive skin and a minimalist soap-nuts option. Each type has its unique benefits and is easy to make with a few basic ingredients. Powdered laundry detergent tends to be more effective and easier to store, while liquid and gel detergents are great for those who prefer a more traditional detergent consistency. These recipes are quick to prepare, taking about 10 minutes from start to finish. Whether you\u2019re new to DIY or a seasoned pro, these recipes will help you create a homemade detergent that\u2019s both economical and environmentally friendly. This homemade laundry detergent recipe is perfect for those who prefer a more traditional approach to cleaning their clothes. Plus, it\u2019s cost-effective and free from harsh chemicals, making it a great choice for families with sensitive skin. Perfect For: Busy families who want a quick and dry solution. Ingredients 1 cup Baking Soda  1 cup Washing Soda - acts as a cleaner and deodorizer, 1 cup Borax (optional) - helps remove stains and brightens whites 1 bar Castile Soap, finely grated - is the primary cleaning agent Instructions Grate the Soap: Use a cheese grater or food processor for a fine, fluffy consistency. Combine: In a large bowl, mix baking soda, washing soda, and borax (if you\u2019re using it). Add Soap: Stir in the grated soap until everything\u2019s evenly combined. This process takes about 10 minutes and yields an effective, easy-to-store detergent. Store: Transfer to an airtight container\u2014an upcycled glass jar works great. How to Use Load Size: 1\u20132 tablespoons per load, depending on how soiled your laundry is. Water Temp: Works in cold or warm water. If you notice residue on cold cycles, dissolve the powder in a bit of warm water before adding it. If you live in a humid climate, store your powdered detergent in a sealed container with a small silica gel packet or place a clean, dry cloth inside to absorb extra moisture and prevent clumping For cloth diapers or heavily soiled items, some users suggest adding a scoop of oxygen bleach or running an extra rinse to ensure complete removal of odors Perfect For: Those who love a super-natural, minimalistic approach. Ingredients 1 cup Crushed Soap Nuts (around 15\u201320 nuts) 4 cups Water Instructions Boil: Combine soap nuts and water in a saucepan, bring to a gentle boil. Simmer: Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes. Cool & Strain: Let it cool, then strain out the soap nuts (they can go straight into your compost!). Store: Keep in a sealed container. How to Use Load Size: About 1/4 cup per regular load. Scent Boost: Add 5\u201310 drops of essential oil (like lavender or lemon) to the final detergent if you want a gentle fragrance. Why I Adore Soap Nuts: They\u2019re biodegradable, hypoallergenic, and grown by nature\u2014like the ultimate \u201cclean living\u201d hack! Note: soap nuts alone may struggle with heavy odors (like workout clothes), so consider adding extra baking soda or a vinegar rinse if you\u2019re tackling strong smells. Prefer liquid detergent? This recipe is for you. This homemade liquid laundry detergent is perfect for those who prefer a liquid laundry soap and is especially effective in hard water conditions. It\u2019s also a great way to avoid the plastic waste associated with commercial liquid laundry detergents and to create your own laundry soap. Perfect For: People who love the convenience of liquid detergent but want complete control over ingredients. Ingredients 1/2 cup Liquid Castile Soap 1/2 cup Washing Soda 1/2 cup Baking Soda 1/4 cup Coarse Salt (helps soften water) 15 drops Organic Essential Oil (optional) Instructions Mix the Dry Ingredients: In a medium bowl, combine washing soda, baking soda, and salt. Add Castile Soap: Slowly stir in the liquid castile soap. Add a few tablespoons of warm water if it\u2019s too thick. Scent It: Stir in essential oils if you want a light aroma. Store: Pour into an airtight jar. How to Use Load Size: 1\u20132 tablespoons per load. Shake or stir before each use, as separation can occur. For extreme odors, you may want an extra tablespoon of baking soda. Shelf Life: Because this is semi-liquid, give it a stir or shake before each use. If you or your loved ones are prone to rashes, eczema, or allergies, here\u2019s a specialized recipe focused on mild, soothing ingredients. It leaves out borax and strong fragrances altogether. 1 cup Washing Soda 2 cups Baking Soda \u00bd cup Finely Grated Castile Soap (unscented bar) (Optional) \u00bd cup Colloidal Oatmeal (very fine\u2014helps soothe itchy skin; can add a mild texture but wash residue out thoroughly) Blend Dry Ingredients: In a bowl, combine washing soda, baking soda, and colloidal oatmeal (if using). Add Soap: Stir in the finely grated castile soap until evenly mixed. Store: Keep in a sealed container, away from moisture. Amount: About 1 tablespoon for small loads, 2 tablespoons for larger or heavily soiled loads. Why It\u2019s Gentle: No Borax: Some people find borax irritating. Colloidal Oatmeal: Adds a skin-soothing element (optional). Unscented: Avoid synthetic fragrances or even essential oils if you\u2019re extremely sensitive. If you experience leftover residue or dryness in very hard water, add 1/4 cup of vinegar to the rinse cycle. And if you\u2019re unsure about soap type, consider castile made from coconut or olive oil for extra gentleness Use a Double Rinse Cycle: Make sure all detergent residue is out, especially if your skin is reactive. Test an Item: Do a small test wash with an old shirt to confirm no irritation occurs. Soften Naturally: Add \u00bd cup white vinegar to the rinse cycle to soften clothes\u2014no chemical fabric softeners needed. Vinegar Rinse: Swap out chemical-laden fabric softeners for half a cup of white vinegar in the rinse cycle. It naturally softens clothes and helps remove any leftover detergent residue. Spot Treatments: Stubborn stains? Pre-treat with a paste made from baking soda and water, or dab a little liquid castile soap directly on the stain. Let it sit before tossing into the wash. Go Warm for Whites: If you want to keep whites looking bright, occasional warm washes (plus a scoop of oxygen bleach if you have it) can do wonders. Sensitive Skin?: Pick a recipe without borax, skip the essential oils, and do an extra rinse cycle for peace of mind. Hard Water? : Increase washing soda or add \u00bd cup of white vinegar in the rinse cycle to combat mineral buildup. Label Everything: Once you start DIY-ing multiple household products, you\u2019ll thank yourself for labeling jars clearly (and adding the recipe for easy refills). Gentler on Skin: Commercial detergents often contain sulfates, artificial scents, and brighteners that linger on clothes and can irritate skin. Eco-Friendly: You\u2019re reducing plastic waste (fewer detergent jugs), and using biodegradable or naturally derived ingredients. Cost-Effective: Most homemade recipes amount to mere cents per load. Customizable: Whether you want zero fragrance for allergies or a fresh lemon scent from essential oils, it\u2019s up to you. I find that making my own laundry detergent is the most budget-friendly route. But life can get busy. Sometimes I don\u2019t have the extra ten minutes to whip up a batch, and that\u2019s when I reach for these store-bought non toxic detergent brands.

Learn more \u2192 \u00a0 Ever found yourself holding your breath while spritzing hairspray, wondering what on earth you\u2019re inhaling? You\u2019re not alone! Hairspray is a staple in many of our beauty routines, but it\u2019s high time we give those chemical-laden bottles a second thought. Lucky for us, there\u2019s a whole bunch of the best natural hairspray brands out there that keep your style intact without compromising your health. Traditional hairsprays might give you that rock-solid hold, but they often come with a cocktail of chemicals that can do more harm than good. Ingredients like PFAs, phthalates, parabens, formaldehyde releasers, and siloxanes are common culprits. For instance, PFAS\u2014often dubbed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d\u2014are linked to cancer, thyroid issues, and other health problems. In a recent study, Purdue University researchers discovered that toxic substances can still linger in the air after using hair sprays. According to this study, you could inhale up to 17 milligrams of harmful chemicals \u2014particularly cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes\u2014 in a single hair care session at home! So while conventional hair care products may improve your hair's appearance, they can also mess up your hormones, trigger allergies, or cause more serious health issues. Then why risk your health with toxic hair sprays when you can switch to non toxic alternatives?  The good news is that there are healthier options available, ranging from dry shampoos to hair conditioners. We know you don't want to compromise on style either, so we\u2019ve compiled a list of natural, yet effective options to help you find the best non toxic hairspray for you! Here's a curated list of the top 10 natural hairsprays to seamlessly integrate into your non-toxic lifestyle!  These gems are made with natural and organic ingredients, skipping the controversial synthetics for a gentler, healthier option. Pacifica Beauty | Shop Here* Josh Rosebrook | Shop Here* Jack Henry | Shop Here* Captain Blakenship | Shop Here*\u00a0 Nature\u2019s Brands | Shop Here* Organic Excellence | Shop Here* \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 John Masters Organics | Shop Here* EVOLVh | Shop Here* Yarok | Shop Here* Lily of the Desert | Shop Here* Finding a truly non-toxic hair spray means understanding a trade-off: the ingredients that give traditional hairsprays their super hold and quick-drying effects are often the ones linked to health risks. Non-toxic alternatives might not deliver the same firm hold, but they prioritize your health and the environment, offering a softer, more natural finish. Some hairsprays, however, offer a middle ground. They add a few synthetic ingredients for stronger hold but avoid the most harmful toxins. The choice is yours\u2014whether you prefer a fully natural product or a bit more hold with minimal risks. To simplify your search, we\u2019ve divided our recommendations into two categories: \u2022 \u201cBest\u201d Non-Toxic Hairsprays: Made with natural and organic ingredients, these products skip controversial synthetics for a gentler, healthier option\u2014perfect if you\u2019re okay with a lighter hold. \u2022 \u201cBetter\u201d Non-Toxic Hairsprays: These options include small amounts of mild synthetics, sodium benzoate, or quats (quaternary ammonium compounds), but in limited quantities. While these provide stronger hold, they come with some risks, which we\u2019ve fully outlined so you can decide if they\u2019re acceptable for you. In the end, it\u2019s all about what matters most to you. We\u2019ve curated our top picks with transparency, giving you clear insights to choose a hairspray that aligns with your health goals and styling needs. So, without further ado, let's explore the best natural hairsprays!

Shop Lily Of The Desert here*  Image @ Lily Of The Desert According to one study from the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, hair sprays can contain PFAS substances. These chemicals are linked to cancer and other health problems. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. Unfortunately, traditional hairsprays contain many controversial ingredients that could affect both your health and the environment. Learning to read ingredients lists or using ingredient checker apps can help you determine if a personal care product is safe or harmful to your health. Let's take a look at some toxic ingredients that shouldn't be in your natural hairspray ingredients list. To make informed choices, here\u2019s a quick rundown of ingredients you might want to skip: Parabens \u2013 Harsh preservatives linked to hormone disruption. Phthalates (Diethyl Phthalate) \u2013 Endocrine disruptors, often hidden under the term 'Fragrance'. Formaldehyde Releasers \u2013 Like DMDM hydantoin, quaternium-15, diazolidinyl urea, polyoxymethylene urea, and imidazolidinyl urea, linked to cancer and allergic reactions. Sulfates \u2013 These substances may be contaminated with 1,4-dioxane, a chemical linked to cancer. Silicones \u2013 These chemicals may build up on hair, blocking moisture and leading to dryness. Fragrance \u2013 Companies aren\u2019t required to disclose the specific chemicals used in their fragrances. Sodium Benzoate \u2013 This preservative is generally considered safe but it might release cancer-causing chemical benzene when combined with Vitamin C. Sodium Hydroxide \u2013 This ingredient may irritate the scalp. Denatured Alcohol \u2013 This ingredient can dry out hair and may irritate the scalp.  Here\u2019s a list of common ingredients found in natural hairsprays: Aloe vera Biotin Coconut oil Sea salt Seaweed Seed oils Green tea Brown sugar Cane sugar Witch Hazel Rice protein Yucca Honey Acacia Senegal gum Essential Oils Plant Extracts Another easy way to identify clean beauty products is by looking for third-party certifications.  A third-party certification backs up a company's claims, which helps us recognize truly sustainable options. Here are some useful certifications to identify cruelty free, organic, and non toxic hair sprays: \u2022 USDA Organic: Ensures at least 70% organic ingredients. \u2022 COSMOS Organic: Guarantees products are free from harmful substances. \u2022 Made Safe: Verifies products are free from 6,000+ toxic chemicals. \u2022 Leaping Bunny & PETA Certified: Confirms no animal testing. \u2022 EWG Verified: Indicates products without harmful chemicals. Non-toxic hairsprays prioritize your health and the planet, offering a softer, more natural finish. While they might not give you that helmet-head hold (and who really wants that?), they provide enough staying power to keep your style looking fabulous all day. Pro Tip: When switching, give your hair a little time to adjust. Natural products might interact differently with your hair type, but the benefits are well worth it! Using non toxic and natural hairsprays reduces your exposure to harmful chemicals like parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, and benzene, protecting your health while adding texture to your hair. Natural hairsprays offer a gentle hold, while non toxic hairsprays add a small amount of synthetic ingredients for stronger hold with minimal risks. Third-party certifications such as USDA Organic, Made Safe, and EWG Verified, help you identify products that are free of harmful substances. Keep making informed choices by double-checking the ingredients of your hair sprays and other personal care products to slowly remove toxic chemicals from your life.

Why is this one so important when it comes to clean non toxic living? It's not hard to tell... it goes ALL over your body! When you use body wash, you cover more surface area of your skin than when you use shampoo, deodorant, and face wash combined! As we know, these products not only contact the surface but are also absorbed into our skin and even our bloodstream! So what's in your body wash? Are you aware of the potential health risks associated with the harmful chemicals often found in conventional body washes? The scary thing is, these chemicals have been linked to health risks like hormonal disruption, skin irritation, brain disfunction and even cancer! Let's dig in and discover all you need to know about the best non toxic and clean body washes on the market and how to find one that's best for you! Empower yourself with knowledge and protect yourself against toxins hiding in plain sight.  Natural body wash does exist! And in the realm of personal care products, terms like \"natural,\" and \"organic,\" are often used interchangeably, but they do have distinct meanings. Natural: Generally refers to products that contain ingredients sourced from nature, such as plant extracts, essential oils, and minerals. However, it's essential to note that the term \"natural\" is not regulated by any governing body, so products labeled as natural may still contain synthetic or potentially harmful ingredients. Organic: Indicates that the ingredients in a product were grown without the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Certified organic products are regulated by reputable organizations like the USDA Organic seal or the EWG Verified mark., which sets standards for organic farming and production methods. When it comes to choosing a non toxic body wash, the term 'non-toxic' is pivotal. Non-toxic body wash is designed to be safe for your skin, free from harmful chemicals that are often found in traditional body washes. These chemicals, ranging from parabens to phthalates, can have various negative effects, including disrupting hormones, causing skin irritation, and even contributing to more severe health issues. Later in this article, we'll touch on the common harmful chemicals typically found in many body washes and explain why they're problematic. Make sure to stick around after the round up for that!  When seeking the best natural and non toxic body wash, look for products that prioritize clean, plant-based ingredients and avoid harmful chemicals. Consider factors such as ingredients, certifications, brand transparency and effectiveness to select the very best non toxic body wash for you.

Some common harmful chemicals to avoid in toxic body wash products include: Parabens: Commonly used as preservatives, parabens like methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben are linked to hormonal imbalances and reproductive issues, with potential connections to breast cancer. Phthalates: These chemicals, often hidden in fragrances, are used to enhance plastic flexibility and as solvents. They\u2019re associated with disrupting hormones and causing reproductive and developmental toxicity. Watch out for phthalates such as diethyl phthalate (DEP), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Sulfates (SLS/SLES): Sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate are surfactants that strip natural oils from the skin, leading to dryness and irritation. Opt for sulfate-free body washes for a gentler approach to cleansing. Synthetic Fragrances: These fragrances may contain unlisted harmful chemicals. Products scented with natural essential oils or labeled as \"fragrance-free\" are safer alternatives. Formaldehyde and Formaldehyde Releasers: Known carcinogens, these substances like DMDM hydantoin, imidazolidinyl urea, and quaternium-15, can cause allergic reactions and respiratory issues. Triclosan: Once a common antibacterial agent, triclosan has been largely phased out due to concerns over hormonal impacts and antibiotic resistance. Still, it's worth double-checking labels to avoid it. While these are some of the major culprits, other ingredients like Polyethylene Glycols (PEGs), Ethanolamines(MEA/DEA/TEA), Siloxanes (Dimethicone/Cyclomethicone), Mineral Oil and Petroleum Derivatives also pose risks. They can range from carcinogenic contaminants to skin irritants and environmental hazards. By being aware and choosing non-toxic body washes made with natural and organic ingredients, you're making a healthier choice for your skin and your overall wellbeing.  The benefits of using non-toxic (often referred to as organic or natural) body wash are numerous, focusing on both health and environmental advantages.

Yes, natural body washes are often better suited for sensitive skin than their conventional counterparts. Natural body washes are formulated with gentle, non-irritating ingredients such as botanical extracts, essential oils, and plant-based surfactants, which are less likely to cause allergic reactions or skin sensitivities. Like we've discussed in this article, natural body washes are free of harsh chemicals like parabens, sulfates, and synthetic fragrances, which can exacerbate sensitivity and irritation in sensitive skin types. Always patch test new products and choose fragrance-free options if you have sensitive skin. Not necessarily. While artificial fragrances and colors can contain potentially harmful chemicals, natural fragrances and colors derived from plant-based sources are generally safer and may offer additional skincare benefits. However, some individuals may still be sensitive to natural fragrances or essential oils, so it's essential to patch test products and choose fragrance-free options if you have allergies or sensitivities. Additionally, artificial colors are often unnecessary in skincare products and may be avoided in favor of naturally derived alternatives. Natural and organic ingredients are chosen for their gentle and nourishing properties, making them suitable for individuals with various skin concerns. However, it's essential to select a body wash formulated for your specific skin type and needs, whether you're looking for extra hydration, gentle exfoliation, or soothing ingredients. Again, patch testing new products and consulting with a dermatologist can help ensure compatibility and efficacy for your skin type. *The links are so-called 'affiliate links.'

In the world of hair care, the term 'non-toxic' is gaining momentum. But what does it really mean? While all products, from organic shampoos to everyday items like coconut oil and baking soda, contain chemicals, it's the type of chemicals that makes all the difference. Non-toxic shampoos and conditioners are formulated with a focus on safety and natural ingredients, conscientiously avoiding known harmful chemicals. This approach involves steering clear of harmful substances such as sulfates, parabens, phthalates, and artificialfragrances, commonly found in conventional hair care products. Embracing plant-based, natural, and organic ingredients, non-toxic hair care offers a safer, more nurturing alternative for hair and scalp. These products often focus on environmental health as well, featuring biodegradable formulas and sustainable packaging, aligning personal care with ecological responsibility. Determining whether a shampoo is toxic involves a good look at the label. It's important to understand the listed ingredients and their potential impact on your health as well as some background on the brand. Here are some key considerations: Ingredient List: Look for red flags like sulfates (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate are the two most common), parabens, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances. These are common toxic substances in hair care products. Certifications: Check for certifications like USDA Organic, EcoCert, or the Leaping Bunny. These labels often indicate a product is free from certain harmful chemicals. Transparency: Brands committed to non-toxic ingredients will usually be transparent about their formulations. Look for detailed ingredient information and their safety standards. Research: Utilize resources like the Environmental Working Group\u2019s (EWG) Skin Deep database, which rates the toxicity of personal care products as body washes, body lotions, cosmetics etc. Irritation and Allergies: Pay attention to how your scalp and skin react. Frequent irritation or allergic reactions can be a sign of harsh chemicals in your shampoo. Remember, the absence of a strong fragrance or luxurious lather does not necessarily mean a product is toxic-free. Although these are often the result of synthetic additives, it's important to be thorough and do your research. When selecting a natural shampoo, consider these steps to making the best choice for you: Step 1. Identify Your Hair Type: Choose a product formulated specifically for your hair type, whether it's oily hair, dry, curly, or color-treated hair. Step 2. Examine Ingredients: Prioritize chemical free shampoo with beneficial ingredients like natural aloe vera, coconut oil, tea tree oil, or shea butter, and avoid long lists of unrecognizable chemicals. Step 3. Seek Certifications: Look for certifications such as USDA Organic or EcoCert, which can authenticate the shampoo's natural claims. Step 4. Check pH Balance: Opt for shampoos with a balanced pH, which will be gentler on your hair and scalp. Step 5. Assess Brand Ethics: Choose brands that are transparent about their ingredients, manufacturing processes, and environmental impact. Step 6. Read Reviews: Consult reviews and recommendations, especially from individuals with similar hair types and concerns.  Finding the right natural shampoo may require some experimentation, but the effort is worth it for the benefits of a gentler, more natural product. Here are some of the key ingredients to avoid: Sulfates (like Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate): Often used for their lathering properties, sulfates also strip the hair and scalp of natural and necessary oils, leading to dryness and irritation. Parabens (such as Methylparaben, Propylparaben): Used as preservatives, these chemicals can disrupt hormonal balance and have been linked to health concerns. Phthalates: Commonly found in fragranced products, phthalates are associated with reproductive and developmental issues. Synthetic Fragrances: These can cause allergies and skin sensitivities. Products that instead contain essential oils are a much better option. Formaldehyde Releasers: These preservatives release a small amount of formaldehyde over time, which is a known carcinogen. Examples: quaternium-15, DMDM hydantoin, imidazolidinyl urea, diazolidinyl urea, polyoxymethylene urea, sodium hydroxymethylglycinate, bromopol and glyoxal Silicones (like Dimethicone): While they make hair feel smooth, silicones can build up over time, weighing down hair and preventing essential moisture from penetrating the hair shaft. Look for ingredients that have these endings: \u2013cone, \u2013conol, \u2013silane or \u2013siloxane. Alcohol (certain types like Isopropyl alcohol): Some forms of alcohol can be overly drying to the hair. Examples: ethanol, propanol, propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and SD alcohols. Synthetic Colors: Often, these are derived from petroleum and can cause scalp irritation. Carefully check labels to make sure your natural shampoo and conditioner don't contain these ingredients. Non-toxic shampoos offer a gentler touch for both your scalp and hair, reducing the risk of irritation, dryness, and damage. Over time, using non-toxic shampoos can improve the overall health and appearance of your hair, avoiding the build-up often caused by synthetic ingredients in conventional shampoos and conditioners and from color treated hair. You'll find yourself with a healthier scalp and more vibrant hair.  You'll also minimize your contact with harmful chemicals that can be absorbed by your skin, thus reducing the risk of related health concerns. Non toxic shampoos are not only kinder to your body but also to the environment, often featuring biodegradable ingredients and eco-friendly packaging. Many non-toxic hair care brands also engage in ethical practices, like cruelty-free testing and sustainable sourcing, supporting broader ethical consumerism. Transitioning to natural shampoos can be a process of adjustment for your hair and scalp. Here's what you should know: Initial Transition Phase: When you first switch to natural shampoos, you might notice your hair feeling different. This is normal. Conventional shampoos strip natural oils from your hair, and your scalp may have been overcompensating by producing more oil. A natural shampoo allows your scalp to rebalance its oil production. Patience is Key: It may take a few weeks for your hair to adjust. During this period, your hair might feel greasier or drier than usual. Be patient as your scalp adapts to the gentler formula and returns to its innate ability to maintain the ideal amount of oil. Detoxing Process: Your hair is undergoing a detoxing process, removing residues left by conventional products. You might experience changes in hair texture or an increase in scalp flakiness as your hair returns to its natural state. Styling and Appearance: You may need to experiment with styling techniques, as your hair's response to natural shampoos can vary. Give your hair some time to reveal itself the way it was born to be! Long-Term Benefits: Once your hair adjusts, you'll likely notice it looking and feeling healthier, with a better balance of oils and visible vitality. Embracing natural shampoos is a commitment to your hair's health. While the adjustment period can be a bit challenging, the long-term benefits of using natural, non-toxic hair care products are well worth the wait. Adding the following tips to your non-toxic haircare routine will take the health and appearance of your hair to the next level. Important aspect is being mindful of the products used to color and treat your hair. Conventional hair dyes often contain harsh chemicals that can damage over time. For a healthier alternative, explore natural hair dyes made with nourishing plant-based ingredients like henna, indigo, and chamomile. These gentle formulas allow you to enhance color while caring for your strands, providing benefits like improved shine, softness, and even gray coverage. An ACV rinse can rejuvenate hair by restoring your scalp to a balanced pH. Healthy hair starts with a healthy scalp. It will also help close your hair cuticles, supporting your hair in being able to absorb and lock in moisture, resulting in a smoother, softer appearance. For a rinse, mix one part ACV with five parts water. After shampooing and conditioning, apply the diluted ACV evenly to your hair and scalp. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the vinegar to break down the excess oil and build up. Then, thoroughly rinse your hair. This routine addition can be especially beneficial for those with oily or dandruff-prone scalps, as ACV has natural antibacterial and antifungal properties.  Healthy hair really starts from within. What you eat and drink has a direct impact. Incorporate foods rich in proteins, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamins A, C, E, and B. These nutrients are vital for hair strength, growth, and shine. Foods with lots of protein, like lean meats, beans, and nuts, are essential for hair structure. Hydration also plays a crucial role. Drinking enough water ensures that your hair stays moisturized and healthy from the inside out. Maintaining healthy hair also involves regular trimming and cautious use of heat styling. Trimming hair every 6-8 weeks helps prevent split ends, reducing breakage and maintaining your hair's overall health. When it comes to styling, excessive heat can weaken hair strands. Opt for low-heat styling methods and always use a heat protectant. Embracing air-drying and experimenting with no-heat hairstyles can also preserve hair integrity. Yes, many conventional shampoos and conditioners contain ingredients that can be harmful to hair. These include sulfates, which strip hair of natural oils, parabens that can disrupt hormonal balance, phthalates, and artificial fragrances that can cause scalp irritation and have been linked to other health issues. These ingredients can lead to dryness, irritation, and long-term damage to hair and scalp health. Natural shampoos are often better for hair in the long run. They are formulated with gentler ingredients that cleanse without stripping natural oils, maintaining the hair\u2019s natural balance. They also usually contain nourishing ingredients that promote scalp health and hair vitality. While the transition to natural shampoos may require an adjustment period, they ultimately lead to healthier, more balanced hair. To find a healthy shampoo, focus on products with natural and nourishing ingredients, avoid harmful chemicals like sulfates and parabens, and choose shampoos suitable for your hair type. Look for transparent brands with positive reviews and certifications like USDA Organic or EcoCert. It may take some trial and error to find the perfect match for your hair.

It\u2019s time to scrutinize body lotions with the same rigor.

Shop ATTITUDE here*  Image @ Attitude Identifying whether a body lotion is truly natural involves examining its ingredient list for ingredients derived from nature rather than synthetics. Look for plant-based oils, herbal extracts, and natural butters, which should be prominently featured and not buried beneath a list of chemical names. Additionally, genuine natural lotions typically avoid using artificial fragrances and colors, opting instead for their ingredients' natural scents and hues.  Choosing a natural body lotion involves more than just reading the label for \"natural\" claims. Use this checklist to ensure you're selecting a product that aligns with ethical and health-conscious standards: Natural Ingredients: Look for lotions that list natural, plant-based ingredients such as aloe vera, coconut oil, shea butter, or herbal extracts at the beginning of their ingredients list. Certifications for Safety and Purity: EWG Verified: Products have been screened for harmful ingredients and found safe based on rigorous criteria. USDA Organic: Contains at least 95% organic ingredients, free from synthetic additives and pesticides. Sustainability Practices: Choose products that use recyclable and or refillable packaging and ingredients sourced through responsible, sustainable practices. Cruelty-Free Certification: Ensure no animal testing is involved in the product's development. Look for Leaping Bunny or PETA certifications. Transparency and Brand Ethics: Opt for brands that are transparent about their ingredient sourcing and production processes. They should provide detailed information about the safety and origin of its ingredients. Absence of Harmful Chemicals: Last but definitely not least, make sure the lotion doesn't contain any of the harmful chemicals listed below. You may be familiar with a lot of these if you've gone down this road before with an upgrade to non toxic body wash or other clean skin care products. This is the list of the no-nos, the bad stuff: Parabens (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl) \u2013 Often used as preservatives, linked to hormonal disruptions and potential breast cancer risks. Phenoxyethanol \u2013 Used as a preservative. Can cause skin and lung irritation. DMDM Hydantoin \u2013 Used as a preservative. It is a formaldehyde releaser known for its carcinogenic properties. Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA) \u2013 Used as a preservative. Potential endocrine disruptor and carcinogen. Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) \u2013 Another formaldehyde-releasing preservative that can be toxic. Fragrance or Perfume (Synthetic Fragrances) \u2013 Often contains phthalates and other undisclosed chemicals. Phthalates \u2013 Associated with hormonal disruptions and reproductive problems. Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES) \u2013 Can irritate skin and may contain carcinogenic contaminants. Triethanolamine \u2013 Used as an emulsifier; can be irritating and allergenic. Ethanolamine \u2013 Another emulsifier that can be irritating to the skin and eyes. Triclosan \u2013 An antibacterial agent linked to hormone disruption and antibiotic resistance. Siloxanes (e.g., cyclotetrasiloxane) \u2013 Used to soften and smooth cosmetics; suspected endocrine disrupter. By now, you can probably see very clearly that conventional body lotion is full of some pretty dangerous ingredients. They're dangerous to your own health and the health of the Earth. So, if your well-being and the planet are of any concern to you, a non toxic body lotion is your best choice. Take your non toxic lifestyle to the next level by creating a non toxic personal care routine and upgrading to a natural body lotion.  The best lotions with the fewest harsh chemicals are those with minimal ingredient lists and recognizable components. These lotions prioritize quality over quantity, often featuring organic ingredients that provide natural benefits without the need for synthetic additives. Lotion can be either toxic or non-toxic, depending on its composition. Non-toxic lotions are formulated without harmful chemicals and rely on natural, often organic, ingredients to provide their benefits. The healthiest skin lotions are those that are free from parabens, fragrances, sulfates, and other harmful chemicals. They nourish the skin using natural ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil, and aloe vera. Many brands now offer paraben-free body lotions. Look for products that clearly state \"paraben-free\" on their labels and prioritize natural preservatives like vitamin E or rosemary extract. Of course, always check the ingredient list as well.

This growth speaks volumes about today's health-aware consumer. A staggering 60% of what we apply to our skin is absorbed into our bodies, making the choice of a non-toxic deodorant more significant than you might think. While traditional deodorants often contain questionable substances like aluminum and parabens, non-toxic alternatives offer a safe and effective solution.  Image by Orbasics The key to a non-toxic deodorant lies in its formulation. These products shun the use of toxic chemicals that raise health and environmental concerns, focusing instead on natural and safe ingredients. Non-toxic deodorants typically avoid aluminum, parabens, phthalates, triclosan, and artificial fragrances \u2013 all of which are commonly found in traditional deodorants but have been linked to various health issues. Instead, they harness the power of natural ingredients like baking soda, arrowroot powder, and plant-based oils, which work effectively to neutralize body odor without harming the skin. Essential oils are often used to add a pleasant scent, offering a refreshing aroma without resorting to synthetic fragrances. Bonus points when a non-toxic deodorant is cruelty-free and comes in eco-friendly packaging, reflecting a commitment to sustainability and ethical practices. By choosing clean non-toxic deodorants, consumers can enjoy the dual benefits of effective odor control and peace of mind, knowing they are making healthier choices for themselves and the environment.

Shop Aesop here*  Image @ Aesop These were the best non toxic natural deodorants that work. Many conventional deodorants contain ingredients that raise health concerns. Aluminum compounds, used for their antiperspirant properties, have been linked to skin irritation and are suspected to interfere with estrogen receptors. Parabens, commonly used as preservatives, are potential endocrine disruptors. Triclosan, an antibacterial agent, can contribute to antibiotic resistance and potentially affect thyroid function. Phthalates, often found in synthetic fragrances, are known to disrupt hormonal systems. When choosing deodorants, it's crucial to be aware of certain chemicals: Aluminum: Used to block sweat but may have estrogen-like effects. Parabens: Preservatives that can mimic estrogen and disrupt hormonal balance. Triclosan: Potentially impacts thyroid function and contributes to antibiotic resistance. Phthalates: Linked to hormonal disruption, particularly concerning during pregnancy and childhood. Propylene Glycol: Can cause skin irritation and is potentially harmful in large quantities. Opt for deodorants with natural and safe ingredients: Baking Soda: Neutralizes odors effectively but can irritate the skin. Arrowroot Powder: Absorbs moisture and soothes the skin. Essential Oils: Provide natural fragrance, and some have antibacterial properties. Coconut Oil: Moisturizes and has antimicrobial properties. Shea Butter: Nourishes the skin and offers a smooth application. In addition to the basic ingredients like baking soda and coconut oil, many non-toxic deodorants incorporate a variety of natural substances to enhance their effectiveness and skin-friendliness: Magnesium Hydroxide: An alternative to baking soda, known for its gentleness on sensitive skin, it effectively neutralizes body odor. Activated Charcoal: Absorbs moisture and draws out toxins, making it an excellent ingredient for natural deodorants. Probiotics: Used in some formulations to balance the skin's microbiome, which can naturally combat odor-causing bacteria. Zinc Ricinoleate: Derived from castor oil, it traps and absorbs odor molecules. Arrowroot and Corn Starch: These natural powders help absorb moisture without irritating the skin. Hyaluronic Acid and Plant Extracts: Offer moisturizing benefits, making the deodorant more skin-friendly. By choosing deodorants with these natural ingredients, consumers can effectively manage body odor while avoiding the health risks associated with traditional deodorants. Antiperspirants and deodorants serve different purposes. Antiperspirants temporarily block sweat glands, reducing perspiration. Deodorants, on the other hand, focus on neutralizing or masking body odor without affecting sweat production. Antiperspirants, through their aluminum-based compounds, create a temporary block in the sweat glands, impeding the natural process of sweating. This action raises concerns about disrupting the body's natural thermoregulation and detoxification. Sweat, a natural and essential bodily function, helps regulate body temperature and eliminate toxins. By blocking sweat, antiperspirants may interfere with these critical processes. Additionally, the buildup of aluminum compounds on the skin has raised health concerns, with debates about their potential links to various health issues. The health implications of using antiperspirants are a topic of ongoing debate. Some concerns include: Blocked Pores: Chronically blocking sweat glands might affect the body's natural cooling and detoxification process, though the extent of this impact is still under study. Health Risks: There have been concerns about the absorption of aluminum and its possible link to breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Skin Irritation: For some individuals, aluminum compounds can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions. While truly non-toxic antiperspirants are rare due to their reliance on aluminum, there are natural alternatives that can help reduce sweat: Natural Astringents: Ingredients like witch hazel or sage can minimize pore size, reducing sweat production mildly. Absorbent Powders: Natural powders like cornstarch or bamboo extract can help absorb excess moisture. Beyond natural astringents and absorbent powders, there are other options for those seeking non-toxic ways to manage sweat: Plant-Based Alcohols: Some natural deodorants use plant-derived alcohols that can help reduce bacteria and moisture on the skin. Mineral Salts: Natural mineral salts, such as potassium alum, create a temporary layer on the skin that inhibits the growth of odor-causing bacteria. Botanical Extracts: Extracts from plants like aloe vera and green tea can offer soothing and mild antimicrobial properties. Clays and Charcoal: Natural clays and activated charcoal are excellent at absorbing moisture and removing impurities from the skin. These alternatives focus on managing body odor and mild sweating without blocking the body's natural sweat production. They provide a more skin-friendly and environmentally responsible approach compared to traditional antiperspirants. Image by Orbasics Creating your own natural deodorant is a cost-effective and customizable way to control body odor using ingredients readily available in many homes. \u00bc cup coconut oil \u00bc cup baking soda (or substitute with arrowroot powder for sensitive skin) \u00bc cup cornstarch 10-15 drops of essential oil (like lavender) In a bowl, mix the baking soda and cornstarch together. Gently melt the coconut oil if it's solid, and combine it with the dry mixture. Add the essential oil and stir until smooth and well combined. Pour the mixture into an empty deodorant container or a small jar. Allow it to solidify at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Apply a small amount under the arms. The coconut oil is antimicrobial and moisturizes, the baking soda and cornstarch help absorb moisture and neutralize odor, and the essential oils add a pleasant scent. Remember, DIY deodorant might take a bit of time to adjust to, and the consistency can vary based on the temperature (coconut oil melts at around 76\u00b0F/24\u00b0C). Shea Butter or Cocoa Butter: Can be used instead of or in combination with coconut oil for a smoother texture. Arrowroot Powder: An alternative to baking soda for those with sensitive skin. Tea Tree Oil: A popular choice for its pleasant scent and natural antibacterial properties. DIY deodorants allow for complete control over the ingredients, making them ideal for those with allergies or sensitivities. They also offer the satisfaction of creating a personal care product that aligns with one's ethical and health values. While DIY natural deodorants offer the appeal of customization and natural ingredients, they also have potential drawbacks. Their effectiveness can vary significantly among individuals, with some finding them less capable of controlling odor or sweat compared to commercial products. For those with sensitive skin, ingredients like baking soda can cause irritation or allergic reactions. Consistency and texture are other issues; these deodorants may melt in warmer temperatures or become too hard in cooler conditions. Additionally, making your own deodorant requires time and effort, which might not be feasible for everyone. Image by Orbasics Similarly to switching to non-toxic shampoo, adapting to non-toxic deodorants involves a transition period. It's beneficial to be ready for some necessary adjustments. Patience is Key: Your body may take time to adjust to the new formula, especially if switching from an antiperspirant. It's common to experience a temporary increase in sweat and odor. Detox Phase: Some individuals experience a detox phase where the body expels toxins and bacteria previously masked or blocked by antiperspirants. This phase can last a few days to a couple of weeks. Hang in there and know that a better way lies ahead. Application Adjustments: Non-toxic deodorants may require different application methods. Some might need to be applied more frequently, while others might have a creamier texture requiring manual application. Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to how your skin reacts. If irritation occurs, consider deodorants with different ingredients. Hygiene and Clothing: Maintaining good hygiene and wearing breathable fabrics can enhance the effectiveness of non-toxic deodorants. Remember, finding the right non-toxic deodorant might involve some trial and error, but the long-term benefits to your health and the environment can be significant and worth it! Switching to a natural deodorant often involves a transitional phase known as the 'detox period', during which you might notice an increase in body odor. This occurs because your body is adjusting to the absence of chemicals that block sweat glands, and it's now expelling built-up toxins and bacteria. This phase varies in duration from person to person. During this time, it's helpful to wear breathable fabrics and maintain good hygiene. The initial increase in odor typically subsides once your body adapts to the natural deodorant. While there is definitely something to be said for capturing the present moment, you might consider starting the switch during a less demanding period, such as a break from work or a less socially active time. This approach allows your body to undergo the detox phase in a low-stress environment, making any increase in sweat or odor less problematic. During this period, wearing breathable clothing and maintaining good hygiene can help manage any temporary changes in body odor as your body adjusts to the natural formula. This strategic timing can make the transition smoother and more comfortable. Aluminum-free deodorants are considered healthier by many due to the absence of aluminum, which is linked to several health concerns. They allow the body to sweat naturally, which is a crucial detoxification process that our bodies need. Yes, non-toxic deodorants can be effective. They use natural ingredients to neutralize body odor, though their efficacy may vary based on individual body chemistry and lifestyle. Many consider natural deodorants better for health and the environment. They avoid potentially harmful chemicals and often come in sustainable packaging. However, effectiveness can vary, and some adjustment time may be needed when switching from conventional products. Many brands offer all-natural deodorants. Look for products with ingredients like essential oils, baking soda, arrowroot powder, and natural butters. *The links are so-called 'affiliate links.'

If you're like me, you've probably avoided daily sunscreen, cringing at the thought of chemical compounds on your skin. But here's the fact: sun protection isn't just important, it's essential for our health and well-being when being exposed to direct sun for hours. Did you know that one in five Americans will develop skin cancer before 70? While seeking shade or wearing UV protective clothing creates a physical defense against harmful UV rays, daily sunscreen is our shield against UV rays, skin cancer, wrinkles, and dark spots. Daily use protects your skin year-round, and it's a crucial part of any anti-aging routine. Sun exposure is the #1 cause of aging, responsible for 90% of visible skin changes over time. As someone passionate about non-toxic living, I've made efforts to find ways to protect my skin without compromising my health. That's where mineral sunscreens come in\u2014they're game-changers in safe sun protection. In this guide, we'll explore the world of mineral sunscreens. You'll learn what they are, how they work their magic, and why they differ from chemical alternatives. I'll share the benefits and challenges, plus my insider tips on choosing the perfect one for your unique skin.  Mineral sunscreens AKA physical sunscreens offer mineral protection from the sun's damaging rays the non-toxic formula is creating a physical separation on your skin from the sun's damaging UV rays. Unlike chemical sunscreens, mineral sunscreens use natural ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to reflect and scatter UV radiation. Think of it as a microscopic shield, bouncing those damaging rays away from your skin. Imagine your skin wrapped in an invisible, protective mirror. That's essentially how mineral sunscreen functions: Physical Barrier: The active ingredients, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide, sit on top of your skin rather than being absorbed. Broad-Spectrum Protection: These minerals effectively deflect both UVA (aging) and UVB (burning) rays, providing comprehensive defense. Immediate Effectiveness: Because they work on the skin's surface, mineral sunscreens start protecting you the moment you apply them. SPF Rating: The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) indicates how much longer you can stay in the sun without burning compared to unprotected skin.  The star players in mineral sunscreens are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. Let's break down their superpowers: Broad-Spectrum Protection: One of the few FDA-approved ingredients that protects across the full spectrum of UV light. Non-Irritating: Gentle on the skin and less likely to cause irritation or allergic reactions, making it suitable for sensitive skin. Non-Comedogenic: Doesn't clog pores, making it ideal for people with acne-prone or oily skin. Water-resistant: Provides extended protection during swimming or sweating. Eco-Friendly: Considered reef-safe, it doesn't harm coral reefs or marine life. Anti-Inflammatory: Has soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. Safe for Long-Term Use: Considered a safe and effective ingredient for daily use. UV Protection: Primarily protects against UVB rays and short-wave UVA rays. Gentle on Skin: Safe for sensitive skin, often found in products for people with reactive skin. Non-comedogenic: Suitable for acne-prone or oily skin. Immediate Protection: Doesn\u2019t need to be absorbed, physically sits on the skin's surface to deflect UV rays. Reef-Safe: Doesn\u2019t harm marine ecosystems or coral reefs. Stable in Sunlight: Photostable and maintains its effectiveness over time. Lightweight and Non-Greasy: Tends to have a lightweight texture. Titanium dioxide is a superstar when it comes to safe sun protection, but there are a few things to keep in mind. While it\u2019s great for your skin, especially in sunscreen, the concern arises when it\u2019s used in nanoparticle form\u2014particularly in spray sunscreens. Inhaling these tiny particles could potentially cause oxidative stress and inflammation, which is why it\u2019s best to stick to non-spray formulas for a safer application. The good news? Regulatory bodies, like the FDA, deem titanium dioxide perfectly safe for topical use in sunscreens. Its minimal absorption through the skin makes it an effective, low-risk choice. For an extra layer of safety, look for products that use coated titanium dioxide to further reduce the chance of free radicals forming. Many mineral sunscreens incorporate additional natural ingredients to enhance protection and nourish your skin: Coconut oil: Contains natural SPF properties, typically around SPF 4-6. Almond Oil: Rich in vitamin E, it acts as an antioxidant to help protect skin. Jojoba oil: Closely resembles human sebum, providing a protective barrier against moisture loss and environmental stressors. Aloe Vera: Contains antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties. Shea butter: Provides moisturizing properties and helps create a protective layer on the skin. Raspberry oil: Contains natural SPF properties (estimated SPF 28-50) due to its high concentration of polyphenols, offering protection against both UVA and UVB rays. By combining these powerful minerals with nourishing natural oils, mineral sunscreens offer effective sun protection while caring for your skin and the environment.  So we understand the ingredients, but these are often found in hybrid and chemical sunscreens. So what's the difference? It's not only about these ingredients; there's a little more to it than that. Hold on! What's hybrid sunscreen? Hybrid sunscreens offer mineral and chemical protection with a thinner formula. While mineral sunscreen reflects UV rays, chemical sunscreen absorbs UV rays. Some ingredients you want to avoid that may appear in chemical and hybrid sunscreens are oxybenzone, octinoxate, parabens, and fragrances. These can mess with your hormones and irritate your skin. According to the Environmental Working Group (EWG), the majority of chemical sunscreens on the market either provide inadequate sun protection or contain potentially concerning ingredients like: Oxybenzone: Causes allergic skin reactions, and behaves like a hormone disruptor. Octinoxate (Octyl methoxycinnamate): Has hormone effects on the metabolic system and affects thyroid hormone production. Homosalate: Can penetrate the skin and disrupt hormones. Octisalate: Possible linkage to allergic contact dermatitis. Octocrylene: Potentially hormone-disrupting and unsafe for coral reefs. Avobenzone: Can disrupt the endocrine system. To ensure you're using a safe and effective mineral sunscreen, consider using the EWG's Skin Deep database or other reputable Ingredient Checker apps. The FDA's sunscreen guidanceand the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendations are also great resources for more information.  When considering personal preferences for physical sun protection and different skin types there could be benefits and downsides you may want to think about. Safe for sensitive skin Broad-spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays Non-toxic formulation Eco-friendly and reef-safe Immediately effective upon application Can feel thicker on the skin May leave a white cast, especially on darker skin tones Requires more frequent reapplication Can be drying if used without moisturizer When selecting mineral or non-toxic sunscreens, the primary goal is to protect yourself from UV rays, as sun exposure can significantly increase the risk of skin cancer. By aligning your skin type with the appropriate sunscreen, you can effectively safeguard your skin. Always perform a patch test with new products to ensure compatibility with your skin. Non-Comedogenic Formulas: Choose sunscreens that won't clog pores or cause breakouts. Texture Considerations: For oily skin, opt for mattifying formulas that help control shine. For dry skin, look for sunscreens with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or shea butter. For combination skin, consider sunscreens with a moisturizer like squalane, which is also beneficial for acne and eczema. Antioxidant Protection: Sunscreens with added vitamin E or green tea extract offer extra antioxidant benefits. For Darker Skin Tones: Select sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in micronized or non-nano forms to minimize visibility on the skin. Once you've chosen your mineral sunscreen, here are some tips to enhance your application experience: Prep Your Skin: Cleanse and moisturize your skin with a clean moisturizer before applying sunscreen. Apply Generously: Use about a nickel-sized amount for your face to ensure adequate coverage. Reapply Often: Reapply every two hours or immediately after swimming or sweating. Cover All Areas: Don't forget often-overlooked spots like your ears and neck, which can burn easily.  Mineral sunscreens are a safe, effective, and eco-friendly alternative to chemical sunscreens. With active ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, they provide broad-spectrum protection against UVA and UVB rays without harmful chemicals. Although they may have drawbacks like a thicker consistency or potential white cast, the benefits of non-toxic sun protection outweigh these minor inconveniences. By selecting the right formula for your skin type and applying it correctly, you can enjoy the sun safely while keeping your skin healthy and protected. Yes, mineral nontoxic face sunscreens are excellent for facial skin as they offer broad-spectrum protection and are gentle, making them ideal for sensitive, acne-prone, or irritated skin. Many mineral sunscreens are designed to work well under makeup. Mineral-based powder sunscreens or setting sprays with SPF make it easier to reapply sunscreen without disturbing makeup. Mineral sunscreens can reduce the risk of skin irritation or dermatitis. They reflect UV rays, while chemical sunscreens absorb them. Check the active ingredients on the packaging. Ingredients like oxybenzone, octinoxate, and cinoxate indicate chemical sunscreens. Look for labels stating \"mineral sunscreen\" or \"physical sunscreen,\" and if unsure, use a Cosmetics Ingredient Checker app. Generally, mineral sunscreens are a safe and effective choice for protecting children's skin.

I've always loved how they instantly create that cozy, calming atmosphere - and I'm not alone. Candles have become a staple in many of our self-care routines. I never really stopped to think about what I was burning, and if you're anything like me, you have probably assumed that burning scented candles is harmless. When I began researching toxic candles, what I discovered made me pause. In fact, conventional candles come with hidden health risks! From synthetic fragrances and petroleum-based waxes to hidden heavy metals in wicks, toxic candles harbor chemicals that we unknowingly release into our homes. Let's explore what's really in our candles and discover healthier alternatives that still create that warm, inviting ambiance we love.  Most of us don't think twice about the materials in our favorite candles. Let's explore why we should. Most candles are made with paraffin wax, a by product of petroleum. While paraffin is affordable and versatile, burning it releases more than just a cozy glow - it emits toxic chemicals, including volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), which pose significant health and environmental concerns The Dangers of Burning Paraffin Wax:  When paraffin burns, harmful VOCs, including benzene, toluene, aldehydes, and hydrocarbons are released into the air. Many of these VOCs are classified as carcinogens, meaning they increase cancer risk, especially with prolonged exposure. Burning scented candles release soot, which not only stains walls and furniture, but can build up in our lungs, raising your risk of respiratory issues, including lung cancer. Here's something you might not know - candles can release VOCs even when they're not lit, silently affecting your indoor air quality by 'off-gassing' into the surrounding space air, and removal of VOCs can be challenging! Fragrances, although they smell glorious, often hide an assortment of chemicals. Synthetic fragrances, common in candles, frequently contain phthalates and other VOCs - especially when heated, their effects become more potent. Phthalates, are used to stabilize and prolong scents, but they're also endocrine disruptors that interfere with our hormones. Prolonged exposure can lead to reproductive and developmental issues, particularly with prolonged exposure, making fragranced candles a growing concern for human health Fragrance Oils vs Essential Oils  While essential oils are derived from plants, capturing the plant's natural scent, fragrance oil are composed of synthetic chemicals used to replicate specific scents, including those not found in nature. Fragrance oil is often favored as it can provide a broader range of scents and can be used at a lower cost than essential oils.  Candle Wicks and Heavy Metals Candles wicks are often overlooked, but can be a surprising source of toxic emissions. While lead-core candle wicks are banned in many place, they may still appear in imported candles. These metallic wicks, used to keep the flame steady and extend burn time, can release harmful lead particles into the air that settle as dust. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure, prolonged exposure to lead has been linked to developmental delays cognitive impairment and even organ damage. Even with zinc or tin wicks, it is important to stay vigilant about potential risks. We spend around 90% of their time indoors, so candle pollutants can have a significant impact, especially for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions. Short-term exposure can cause headaches, coughing and wheezing. In a study, nearly 25% of students exposed to candles for over an hour reported respiratory symptoms Longer-term health effects: Are candles endocrine disruptors? Research shows that long-term exposure may have endocrine-disrupting effects, leading to reproductive issues, increased pregnancy loss in women, and decreased testosterone in males Environmental Impact  Paraffin wax candles also take a toll on the planet. As petroleum byproducts, they contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and have a larger carbon footprint compared to alternative candles like soy or beeswax. The candle industry faces significant challenges, from weak regulations to misleading labels, leaving consumers in the dark about what is truly in their candles In the US, oversight of candle production by agencies like the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency is far less stringent than in the EU, where VOC emissions and harmful chemicals are more tightly regulated Under the Clean Air Act, candles fall outside of the strict air pollution rules, meaning manufacturers are not required to disclose synthetic fragrance chemicals, and can get away with simply labelling them as 'fragrance' on the ingredients Unregulated claims and label transparency: Terms like 'natural', 'eco-friendly' and 'organic' although may seem reassuring are unregulated and often mislead consumers, as many candles labeled as 'non-toxic' may still contain harmful chemicals. This makes it tricky for consumers to identify clean and safe candle options  For candle enthusiasts like me, beeswax candles are the best choice - offering increased safety, sustainability and a reduced environmental impact. In fact, compared to paraffin wax candles, these non toxic candles can lower greenhouse gas emissions by 45-50%! Why Beeswax is Better: All-natural and eco-friendly: Beeswax burns cleanly, emitting minimal soot and VOCs, making it a healthier option compared to paraffin-based candles Air purification (debatable): Some claim beeswax candles can purify the air by releasing negative ions that can bind to the positive ions in pollutants, causing them to become to heavy to fall to the ground, where they can be vacuumed, however, the evidence is limited Choosing high-quality beeswax: Look for 100% beeswax, and is free from synthetic fragrance Avoid bleached beeswax (often lighter or white in colour), as it may have been chemically processed Recommended brands:  \u2022 Living Good Candle Co *, Bluecorn *, Happy Organics* Soy wax candles are a popular non-toxic option\u2014widely available, budget-friendly, and eco-conscious. They are a great alternative if you're looking to reduce your environmental footprint. Why choose soy candles? Sustainable: Made from soybeans, these candles more renewable, and have a cleaner burn that paraffin with lower chemical release Accessibility: Their widespread use makes them an easy, eco-conscious option Potential concerns: GMO soybeans: Many soy wax products come from genetically modified soy. Opt for brands that verify their products as non-GMO. Pesticide contamination: Soybean cultivation often involves heavy pesticide use. Look for brands prioritizing organic practices. Processing chemicals: Some soy waxes are processed with hexane or other chemicals. Choose brands that disclose their production methods and ingredients. Recommended brands:  Slow North*, Siblings* Coconut wax is the new star of the market, celebrated for its eco-friendliness, and longer, clean burn. If you are looking for a sustainable option and with a hint of luxury, coconut candles are a great pick! Why Coconut Wax Stands Out: Sustainable: Made from coconuts\u2014a renewable resource\u2014coconut wax is an environmentally conscious choice. Longer burn time: Its slow-burning properties mean fewer candle replacements. Clean burning: Produces minimal soot, keeping indoor air fresher and surfaces cleaner. Considerations: Blends: Coconut wax can be mixed with other waxes, ensure to check labels to see if combined with paraffin Cost: Coconut wax candles are often pricier, than other alternatives, however, this is reflected in their premium quality Recommended brands:  Bee Lucia *, ARCTIC WICKS*  When on the hunt for natural wax candles, opt for a candle with 100% pure essential oils instead of synthetic chemicals and look for natural wax and unscented candles that skip additives entirely Check for: Transparency: Brands that are transparent about fragrance use and clearly list ingredients to ensure they are fragrance-free Certifications: Labels like 'non-toxic' and 'phthalate-free' or third party seals like Green Seal or EcoCert or MADE SAFE to ensure safety and eco-friendliness The wick also plays a crucial role in ensuring a clean burn: Opt for wicks made from sustainable natural materials like cotton, hemp, or wooden wicks . Avoid metal-core wicks (often found in cheaper candles), to avoid unnecessary metal emissions into the air when burned. By recognizing the distinctions among various candle types and their effects on health and the environment, you can make more informed and mindful choices.  Burning candles responsibly can make a huge difference in reducing risks. Here's how: Increase ventilation: Keep rooms well-ventilated by opening windows or using fans to disperse VOCs. Air purifiers are also a great option to filter allergens and pollutants from the air, enhancing air quality! Limit use: By burning fewer candles at a time, and limiting sessions to 1-2 hours, this can help to mimics pollutants and prevent overheating wax Trim candle wicks: Always trim wicks to around 1/4 inch before lighting to ensure a steadier flame, reduce soot, and minimize smoke Placement matters: Avoid placing candles in drafty spots in your house to prevent uneven burning and excess smoke \"All candles are dangerous\"  Not true! While paraffin candles release VOCs, natural options like soy, beeswax, or coconut wax burn cleaner with fewer pollutants. No candle is completely risk-free, but natural alternatives are far safer. \"Natural candles are completely risk-free\"  Even natural candles (beeswax and soy) produce carbon dioxide when burned. However, their risks are much lower compared to paraffin. By implementing the practical tips for safer use, you can further minimise any potential risks. Simmer Pots: Create your own natural air refesher by simmering citrus slices, herbs, and spices on the stove. It's an easy, customisable way to make your home smell glorious! Natural Potpourri: Craft potpourri from dried flowers, herbs, and spices, for visually pleasing and aromatic option to elevate your homes natural scent. To elevate this, you can also add a essential oils like lavender, rose petals or chamomile Essential Oil Diffusers (my personal fave): A flawless, modern option for scenting your home, these diffusers offer natural fragrances, and even potential wellness benefits e.g. lavender can improve your relaxation and your sleep! Himalayan Salt Lamps: While the air-purifying claims are debated, these lamps pair well with other scenting methods to provide the perfect cozy glow  Health Risks: Burning paraffin wax candles releases harmful VOCs and soot, which contribute to indoor air pollution. These toxics can affect your respiratory health, and can even increase your risk of cancer with prolonged exposure Fragrance Chemicals & Endocrine Disruptors: Synthetic fragrances in candles often contain phthalates and other harmful chemicals. These endocrine disruptors can disrupt hormones, and can lead to reproductive or developmental issues, particularly with long-term exposure Safer Alternatives: For a cleaner, healthier burn, choose beeswax, soy, or coconut wax candle wax. These options produce minimal soot and VOC emission, and are more eco-friendly! Practical Tips: Enhance air quality by increasing ventilation, be sure to trim candle wicks to reduce soot, and limiting burn time to 1-2 hours per session. Always ensure your candles are in a well-ventilated area to disperse pollutants. Non-Candle Alternatives: If you want to scent your home without the risks of candles, try natural using simmer pots, essential oil diffusers, or Himalayan salt lamps. These methods can create a cozy atmosphere without the harmful effects of burning candles. Toxic candles typically contain paraffin wax, which releases harmful chemicals like benzene and toluene when burned. To identify non-toxic options, look for candles made from natural waxes (e.g., beeswax, soy, or coconut), scented with essential oils, and using cotton or wooden wicks. The least toxic candles are made from natural waxes like beeswax, soy, or coconut wax. These options burn cleanly, producing minimal soot and VOCs. For added safety, choose candles scented with pure essential oils and free from synthetic fragrances or dyes, and ensure they use natural wicks like cotton or wood. Some candles containing synthetic fragrances or paraffin wax may emit chemicals that act as endocrine disruptors. Opting for candles made from natural waxes and scented with essential oils significantly reduces the risk of exposure to such harmful compounds. Scented candles with synthetic fragrances can release harmful VOCs like formaldehyde and phthalates, which can irritate the respiratory system and degrade indoor air quality. To minimize risks, choose naturally scented candles made with essential oils and avoid those containing artificial additives or paraffin wax.

Learn more \u2192 Are you ready to transform your home with clean,\u00a0non-toxic candles?\u00a0 Imagine unwinding after a long day with a beautifully scented candle, only to realize it\u2019s filling your home with harmful chemicals. That\u2019s why switching to non-toxic alternatives is more important than ever. Candles made from natural materials like beeswax or soy, and coconut wax offer a healthier, eco-friendly option. They provide a cleaner burn, delightful aromas, and peace of mind\u2014without compromising your health. Certified organic candles go even further, adhering to strict standards to ensure no harmful chemicals or synthetic processes are involved in their production. After hours of research and personally testing these candles, I\u2019ve compiled our personal list of the best non-toxic candle brands of 2025. These brands deliver high-quality, eco-friendly candles that are free from toxins and synthetic fragrances. But first, let\u2019s dive into why non-toxic candles are so important. Nontoxic candles provide a healthier and more eco-friendly alternative to traditional candles. Among the toxic free options, beeswax candles truly shine as the best choice. Beeswax - The Best Choice: Beeswax candles are the top choice for non-toxic options. They burn cleaner, purify the air, and have a longer burn time compared to other natural waxes like soy or coconut. Other Natural Wax Alternatives: If beeswax isn't available, opt for candles made from natural waxes like soy or coconut. These materials still burn cleaner and produce fewer harmful byproducts than traditional paraffin candles. Essential Oils and Sustainable Materials: Look for brands that use 100% essential oils for fragrance and incorporate sustainable materials.

Shop NEOM* Image \u00a9 Neom Toxin free candles utilize natural waxes like soy wax, coconut wax, and beeswax, which are eco-friendly, healthier choices compared to paraffin wax. These waxes have a lower environmental impact, making them an ideal choice for sustainable candles. We'll delve into the benefits of each natural wax option in the subsequent subsections. Soy wax is a renewable resource, environmentally friendly, and provides a cleaner burn than paraffin wax. Made from soybeans, soy candles don't release VOCs or toxins when burned. Beyond their eco-friendly nature, soy candles outlast their paraffin counterparts due to a slower burn rate, leading to better value over time. They are also known for the ability to hold and disperse fragrance effectively, ensuring a pleasant and consistent aroma throughout the burning process. However, soy wax candles do not offer the same air-purifying benefits as beeswax candles and can be even damaging for health when they contain additives or synthetic fragrances that release harmful chemicals when burned. Coconut wax is derived from the cold-pressed meat of coconuts, making it organic and eco-friendly. It offers a superior scent throw and a clean burn, but like soy wax, it lacks the air-purifying properties of beeswax. Coconut wax is often combined with soy wax and offers several benefits. Superior scent throw, effectively dispersing fragrance throughout your space Non-toxic, making them a safe choice Strong and consistent aroma, without harmful chemicals found in traditional candles Beeswax candles are the best choice for nontoxic candles. They are a natural, sustainable and provide a subtle honey scent while purifying the air. Beeswax candles release negative ions that help remove toxins, dust, and other pollutants from the air, creating a cleaner living environment. They also burn longer and brighter than other types of candles, making them a cost-effective and eco-friendly option. As beeswax is a byproduct of honey production, it is a renewable resource and contributes to the support of bee populations. This makes beeswax candles an ideal choice for those seeking a nontoxic candle that not only provides a pleasant fragrance but also contributes to cleaner indoor air quality. Organic beeswax candles are even a better choice, since the beeswax is free from pesticides and other harmful chemicals, offering the cleanest, natural burn. Image \u00a9 Goldrick Certified organic candles stand apart in the candle market by adhering to the strictest standards of purity and sustainability. Unlike other natural candles, certified organic candles: Use waxes that are free from industrial processing and hydrogenation. Avoid GMO origins and pesticides, ensuring a truly natural product. Meet rigorous organic standards, guaranteeing that no synthetic chemicals are involved in their production. By choosing certified organic candles, you make a conscious decision to support products that uphold the highest standards of natural, sustainable but also healthy non toxic living. When shopping for non-toxic candles, keep these factors in mind: Wax Type: Beeswax is the best for clean burning and air purification, followed by soy and coconut wax. Wicks: Opt for 100% cotton or wood wicks to avoid toxic byproducts. Fragrances: Choose candles with 100% essential oils instead of synthetic fragrances. Packaging: Look for brands with eco-friendly, reusable, or recyclable packaging. Candles made with 100% natural waxes and scented only with 100% essential oils are ideal. Real customer reviews can offer valuable insights into the quality and performance of a product, so be sure to check them out before making a purchase. Additionally, choosing a brand that prioritizes sustainability, ethical practices, and transparency about their ingredients can give you peace of mind knowing that you're making a responsible choice for both your health and the environment. Considering these factors can guide you to the perfect natural candle that suits your needs and preferences. Image \u00a9 Goldrick When it comes to choosing the perfect natural candles, the type of wick used is just as important as the wax and fragrance. Choose wicks made from untreated or unbleached cotton, hemp, or wood for a cleaner burn and reduced toxin release. Avoid wicks with metal cores, as they can emit harmful chemicals when burned Choosing wooden wick candles made from natural materials allows you to enjoy the advantages of toxin free natural candles without sacrificing burn quality or indoor safety.  \u00a0 Image \u00a9 Ritual & Fancy Fragrance plays a significant role in the experience of burning a candle. For non-toxic candles, opt for those scented with\u00a0pure essential oils or safe synthetic fragrances to avoid harmful chemicals and toxins. Essential oils are derived from plants and provide a natural alternative to artificial fragrances that may contain hazardous chemicals. Synthetic fragrances can contain thousands of chemicals derived from crude oil, some of which may be carcinogenic and have reproductive toxicity warnings. Opting for candles scented with pure essential oils or safe synthetic fragrances offers a delightful aroma without exposing you or your loved ones to toxic toxins. Soy wax, coconut wax and beeswax candles are all excellent options that are not toxic. For the best results, ensure labels state 100% soy or beeswax and opt for sustainably sourced and cruelty-free products. When choosing between beeswax and soy candles, soy wax is a better choice for those who want a scented candle with a strong, consistent smell that will last the entire burn time. Beeswax offers a longer burn time and purifies the air to prevent allergies or headaches, these are healthy candles to burn, however it is better suited as an unscented candle where its natural oil scent can be released into the air. Many brands offer safe candles ti burn, look out for brands with a range of non-toxic candles made with beeswax, coconut oil, therapeutic-grade essential oils, and a wooden wick, free of fragrance oils and/or\u00a0other harmful ingredients. Non-toxic candles are a healthier and more environmentally friendly choice, as they contain natural waxes, clean-burning wicks and pure essential oils or safe synthetic fragrances, which eliminate harmful toxins and reduce environmental impact. *The links are so-called 'affiliate links.'

Visit www.info.fairtrade.netOur most recent batch of T-shirts have the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark on the label, but some T-shirts from previous batches don\u2019t include the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark.Here\u2019s the reason why:In order to use the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark the full supply chain for the cotton needs to be certified by FLOCERT (the global independent certification body for Fairtrade). Our factory already had GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and Fair Trade USA certification, but in order to label goods with the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark, they also needed to be certified by FLOCERT. So over the past year, we\u2019ve been working with the Fairtrade system and our factory to obtain certification for the seed cotton we use. This year, the factory received the certification which means the seed cotton used in the T-shirts is now fully traceable throughout the supply chain, so our latest T-shirts now include the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark \ud83d\ude4c   \nTip Your Garment Workers\n \nFrom \u00a31   \u00a0 The organic cotton is pre-shrunk before cutting & sewing to minimise shrinkage, but do allow for a small amount of shrinkage on first wash (3-4%). \u00a0 We run a pioneering bonus scheme for garment workers, to ensure they receive a good wage.

Visit www.info.fairtrade.netOur most recent batch of T-shirts have the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark on the label, but some T-shirts from previous batches don\u2019t include the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark.Here\u2019s the reason why:In order to use the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark the full supply chain for the cotton needs to be certified by FLOCERT (the global independent certification body for Fairtrade). Our factory already had GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and Fair Trade USA certification, but in order to label goods with the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark, they also needed to be certified by FLOCERT. So over the past year, we\u2019ve been working with the Fairtrade system and our factory to obtain certification for the seed cotton we use. This year, the factory received the certification which means the seed cotton used in the T-shirts is now fully traceable throughout the supply chain, so our latest T-shirts now include the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark \ud83d\ude4c   \nTip Your Garment Workers\n \nFrom \u00a31   \u00a0 The organic cotton is pre-shrunk before cutting & sewing to minimise shrinkage, but do allow for a small amount of shrinkage on first wash (3-4%). \u00a0 We run a pioneering bonus scheme for garment workers, to ensure they receive a good wage.

REVIEWS I can feel the quality in the shirts I bought and knowing I'm not overpaying for a name, but for ethical means in obtaining quality products makes me feel better about my purchases. I'm happy with the fit and softness. I\u2019m so pleased I found this website.  The T-shirt is lovely and soft, very well made and organic.  The colour is great and will go with lots of other colours.  Recommended.  Thank you.

Fabric Made from 100% Fairtrade and organic cotton.The organic cotton is pre-shrunk before cutting & sewing to minimise shrinkage, but do allow for a small amount of shrinkage on first wash (3-4%).A note about our Fairtrade cottonAll of the cotton is Fairtrade certified, traded, audited and sourced from Fairtrade producers. Visit www.info.fairtrade.netOur most recent batch of T-shirts have the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark on the label, but some T-shirts from previous batches don\u2019t include the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark.Here\u2019s the reason why:In order to use the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark the full supply chain for the cotton needs to be certified by FLOCERT (the global independent certification body for Fairtrade). Our factory already had GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and Fair Trade USA certification, but in order to label goods with the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark, they also needed to be certified by FLOCERT. So over the past year, we\u2019ve been working with the Fairtrade system and our factory to obtain certification for the seed cotton we use. This year, the factory received the certification which means the seed cotton used in the T-shirts is now fully traceable throughout the supply chain, so our latest T-shirts now include the FAIRTRADE Cotton Mark \ud83d\ude4c   \nTip Your Garment Workers\n \nFrom \u00a31   \u00a0 The organic cotton is pre-shrunk before cutting & sewing to minimise shrinkage, but do allow for a small amount of shrinkage on first wash (3-4%). \u00a0 We run a pioneering bonus scheme for garment workers, to ensure they receive a good wage.

Shop the Earth Month Discounts tab Organic Cotton Low Impact Dyes Fair Labor One Tree Planted This perfect new shape adds coziness and flow to complete any look. Open style, higher cropped back, no front closure, and offered in our signature tie dye. For solids, look at our Agnes Drape Cardigan.  Jersey, 100% Organic Cotton Thank you for submitting a review! Your input is very much appreciated. Share it with your friends so they can enjoy it too! Well made, soft, tightly knit cotton, preshrunk. Love the color palate. I bought two and live how versatile and well made the pieces are. Will be going back for more. This tie dye pattern was part of their first signature collection and still remains my favorite! I love the colors, pattern and hue. It's super light to throw over any outfit to add a pop of color. I carry it around in my purse in case I need an extra layer. This cardigan with the matching skirt and their plain white Jane tank was my summer staple. No wonder this set sold out so fast the first time around! Even though it is somewhat short, I also like that I'm able to wear it tied up in the front. I'm 5'5'' and wearing an XS in the photo. Very cute, fun shape, soft material, doesn't wrinkle easily. A tad snug on the biceps, I probably should have sized up to a medium. (140, 5'6\" athletic) I had to wait a little while due to production issues, but I was kept well aware of the progress and was offered an opportunity to cancel. So glad I waited! Lovely lil cardigan in happy colors made in soft fabric. I\u2019ve since ordered 3 more items from YesAnd.\r\n I bought this cardigan, the matching sweatshirt and slim joggers. They are high quality, look great and the %100 cotton feels great. I bought the small joggers and they were too small. The return process was easy and in less than 1 week I am wearing the medium which fit great. This is a great look cardigan. Will buy from this company again.\r\n We use sustainable practices across the entire supply chain, from farm to finished product. Our organic farm project is the heartbeat of YesAnd.

Your input is very much appreciated. Share it with your friends so they can enjoy it too! I ordered these pants in black, and my favorite detail of the pants were the pocket that reads, \u201cLive The Earth\u201d but when I received the pants there is nothing on the pocket. Disappointed ):\r\n The pants are exactly what I was looking for- a stylish, very high waisted pant that I can wear both around the house and to work. I am about 5'7 and 115 lbs and a size S fits great. The waistband is tighter than I expected, which makes it a bit hard to get over my hips but once they are on they are comfortable.

I knew that the tie dye pattern would be different than pictured because they\u2019re done by hand, but I wish mine would have had as much white space as the model\u2019s piece. Mine was much more color and dark than expected. Still cute, but a bit overpowering for me as I was hoping for a lighter look. Also, I got an XL and am 5\u20194\u201d and it\u2019s plenty loose but pretty short. I\u2019d have to wear shorts underneath.
