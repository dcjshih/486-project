    reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. Request restriction of processing of your personal data You have a right to ask boohoo to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain scenarios, for example if

    DPO@boohoo.com. You also have the right to make a complaint to the ICO (the data protection regulator in the UK) or

    list of supervisory authorities can be found here: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en). We

    fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We will take
    all steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.  Whenever we transfer personal data outside the UK, we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by
    ensuring appropriate safeguards, as required by law, are in place. We will be able to transfer your personal data to
    countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data. More information can
    be found here: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers/
    Otherwise, we may use specific contractual clauses approved for use in the UK which give personal data the same
    protection as it has in in the UK. More Information about this can be found on the ICO’s website.
 We will keep your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) it was provided for and to meet
    our legal obligations. Further details of the periods for which we retain data are available on request. From time to time we may change this GDPR Addendum. If there are any significant changes we will post updates on our
    website, applications or let you know by email. We welcome feedback and are happy to answer any questions you may have about your data. Please send any questions, comments or requests for more information to our nominated representative and Data

    Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of your Personal Information).  boohoo may “share” your Personal Information for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, subject to your
    right to opt-out of that sharing (see Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of your Personal Information).
    Our “sharing” for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising would be limited to our use of third-party
    advertising cookies and their use in providing you cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., advertising on other
    websites or in other mediums). When the recipients of your Personal Information disclosed for the purpose of
    cross-context behavioral advertising are also permitted to use your Personal Information to provide advertising to
    others, we also consider this disclosure as a “sale” for monetary or other valuable consideration under the CPRA.
 In the preceding twelve (12) months, boohoo has “sold” for monetary or other valuable consideration, or “shared” for
    the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, the following categories of Personal Information to the
    following categories of third parties: Your Personal Information may be “sold” or “shared” as described above for the following business or commercial
    purposes: We do not “sell” the Personal Information of minors under the age of 16 for monetary or other valuable consideration
    and we do not “share” such Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising without affirmative consent
    as required by the CPRA. More information on how minors under the age of 16 may change their choice regarding the
    “sale” or “sharing” of their Personal Information can be found in Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of
    Your Personal Information.  The CPRA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section
    describes your CPRA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. You may exercise these rights yourself or
    through your Authorized Agent. For more information on how you or your Authorized Agent can exercise your rights,
    please see Exercising Your CPRA Privacy Rights. These rights include the right to: Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. You also have the right to opt-out of our sale or sharing of
    your personal data, as described further below.  You have the right to request that boohoo disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your
    Personal Information over the past 12 months (a “Right to Know” Consumer Request).  You also have the right to request that boohoo provide you with a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information
    that we have collected about you, including any Personal Information that we have created or otherwise received from
    a third-party about you (a “Data Portability” Consumer Request). You have the right to request that we correct any incorrect Personal Information about you to ensure that it is
    complete, accurate, and as current as possible. In addition to other methods you may have to exercise this right as
    described below, you may review and correct some Personal Information about yourself by logging into your account
    page and updating your details directly.  To exercise the rights described above, please submit a request (a “Consumer Request”) to us by either:  If you fail to make your Consumer Request in accordance with the ways described above, we may either treat your
    request as if it had been submitted with our methods described above or provide you with information on how to
    submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with your request.
    Only you, or your Authorized Agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a Consumer Request related to
    your Personal Information. To designate an Authorized Agent, see Authorized Agents below.
 All Consumer Requests must: We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or
    authority to make the request and confirm which Personal Information relates to you or the individual for whom you
    are making the request as their Authorized Agent.
    Making a Consumer Request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made
    through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information
    associated with that specific account.
    We will only use Personal Information provided in a Consumer Request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority
    to make the request.
    For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your
    Personal Information.
 You may authorize your agent to exercise your rights under the CPRA on your behalf by registering your agent with the
    California Secretary of State or by providing them with power of attorney to exercise your rights in accordance with
    applicable laws (an “Authorized Agent”). We may request that your Authorized Agent submit proof of identity and that
    they have been authorized exercise your rights on your behalf. We may deny a request from your Authorized Agent to
    exercise your rights on your behalf if they fail to submit adequate proof of identity or adequate proof that they
    have the authority to exercise your rights.
    In response to a Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Request, we will provide you with all relevant
    information we have collected or maintained about you on or after January 1, 2022, unless an exception applies. The
    response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For Data
    Portability Consumer Request, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable
    and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, such as CSV
    file(s) and/or PDF file(s).
    We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your Consumer Request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
    manifestly unfounded. We reserve the right to consider more than two (2) total Right to Know or Data Portability
    Consumer Requests (or combination of the two) in a twelve (12) month period to be repetitive and/or excessive and
    require a fee. If we determine that your Consumer Request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision
    and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
 As described above, our use of cookies is considered a “sale” under the CPRA. We do not otherwise sell your Personal
    Information for monetary consideration. If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not
    “sell” your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration at any time (the “right to opt-out”).
    We do not “sell” the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we
    receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of
    age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information
    “sales” may opt-out of future “sales” at any time.  If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not share your Personal Information for the
    purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, which is showing advertising on other websites or other media
    based on your browsing history with our websites and applications (the “right to opt-out”). We do not share the
    Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age for this purpose, unless we receive
    affirmative authorization from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian
    of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to our sharing of Personal Information for these
    purposes may opt-out of future such sharing at any time.  To exercise the right to opt-out of the “sale” and the “sharing” your Personal Information for the purposes of
    cross-context behavioral advertising, you may do so by any of the following: clicking the link below, adjusting your
    cookie preferences, or by configuring your browser to send us a privacy signal as described in more detail below.
    You may also opt-out of such “sales” and “sharing” by setting your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or
    to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do not consent to our use of cookies or select this
    setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our websites or applications or other websites. You can find
    more information about cookies at http://www.allaboutcookies.org and http://youronlinechoices.eu.  Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize Personal
    Information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into the sale of Personal Information at any time
    by: If you (or your Authorized Agent) submit a request to opt-in to our “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information,
    we will use a two-step process in order to confirm that you want to opt-in for such “sale” or “sharing” of your
    Personal Information. This may include confirming your choice by a popup box or other requirement to confirm your
    new choice.  You may also exercise your right to opt-out of the “sale” of your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable
    consideration and the “sharing” of your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral
    advertising by setting the privacy control signal on your browser, if your browser supports it. We currently
    recognize and support the following privacy signals sent by browsers: When we receive one of these privacy control signals, we will opt you out of any further “sales” or “sharing” of your
    Personal Information when you interact with our websites or applications through that browser and on that device. We
    will only be able to propagate your choice to opt-out to your account if you are currently logged in when we receive
    the privacy control signal from your browser. When we are able to propagate your choice to your account, you will be
    opted out of “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information on all browsers and devices on which you are logged
    in, and for both online and offline “sales” and “sharing.”  As further described below, we do not use or disclose your Sensitive Personal Information for any purpose other than
    the following: We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CPRA that can result in different prices, rates, or
    quality levels. Any CPRA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal
    Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a

https://terrathread.com/pages/about-terrathread,"Country/region Country/region ABOUT US Terra Thread® backpacks, bags and apparel are created for conscious consumers, corporations and NGOs who are looking to make a positive impact on the world with their purchase. Terra Thread puts people and the planet first, every step of the way from organic farms to your arms. Our Mission Redesigning fashion so that it empowers farmers, rebuilds soils, pays workers fairly, and reduces plastic waste in the world. Our Vision To lead a transformation in regenerative organic cotton farming to heal our planet. TERRA THREAD® was founded by father-daughter duo Vik and Vizan Giri who, astounded by the effects of fast fashion, were inspired to create a product that could have a long-lasting positive impact on the planet. In 2009, Vik founded Gallant International Inc., a B Corp Certified company that supplies businesses with sustainable promotional and retail products. Gallant International is also Terra Thread's parent company. Throughout college, Vizan worked for Gallant. Her passion for social and environmental justice, coupled with the realization that there was an almost total lack of sustainably-produced backpacks and bags in the market, led to Terra Thread. Nearly all backpacks and most bags available in the market are made of synthetic fabrics such as polyester, nylon and other plastic-based materials. These synthetic-based bags deplete our natural resources and have a detrimental impact on human lives and the ecosystem during their production, usage and even post-usage. To solve this problem, Terra Thread crafted bags that are made using 100% organic cotton canvas grown by smallholder and tribal families in India who primarily depend on rain-fed agriculture. This means good for both people and the planet. As an immigrant from Nepal, Vizan has always been connected to South Asia. When the duo started Terra Thread, Vizan was able to connect further with her heritage as all the cotton is sourced from organic cotton farms in India, and the bags are made in a Fair Trade Certified™ factory in India as well. Between Gallant’s business practices and trips to visit farmers and factory workers in India, she gained first-hand experience of what it means for a company to take responsibility for their supply chains, as well as the growing demand and need for ethical products.  Having experienced food paucity himself, co-founder Vik is also passionate about tackling the wider issue of food insecurity, and both Gallant and Terra Thread have joined Feeding America’s campaign to end hunger in the United States.  Terra Thread is a sustainable bag and apparel brand with a mission; to lead a transformation in organic cotton farming, and give consumers better, more planet-friendly choices for everyday essentials.Created for environmentally conscious consumers and designed to last, Terra Thread believes that great backpacks shouldn’t cost the Earth. Recognized by Forbes, Newsweek, TreeHugger and The Good Trade as one of the most sustainable bags on the market, we have sustainability built into our bags at every stage of production. That means fair pay for farmers as well as workers and no toxic chemicals, no synthetic fibers, and no unnecessary packaging. Working directly with organic cotton farmers in India, we’ve gone to every length to ensure that from start to finish our bags are being made in factories that meet the highest ethical and Fair Trade Standards. And because we want sustainable and ethical fashion to become the norm, we are committed to keeping our products affordable, making them as accessible as possible. 
                      Fairtrade Organic Cotton

https://terrathread.com/pages/fairtrade-organic-cotton,"Country/region Country/region FAIRTRADE ORGANIC COTTON All Terra Thread products are made with Fairtrade certified organic cotton. This natural and biodegradable fiber is the better alternative to the harmful synthetic fibers that dominate the fast fashion industry.  Cotton is everywhere. You can find products made with cotton in several everyday goods - your clothes, bedsheets, furniture, and much more. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), “Cotton is one of the most important textile fibers in the world, averaging about 25 percent of total world fiber use.” According to Fairtrade International, around 100 million rural households are engaged in cotton production in more than 75 countries around the globe. In the hopes of increasing yields and income, farmers often turn to Genetically Modified Seeds (GMOs). In reality, “they are tied into buying expensive seeds and pesticides each year from multinational companies amid concerns that yields actually decline after initial gains.” This is not the only problem associated with conventionally grown cotton. In fact, the United States Department of Labor reported that child and forced labor in cotton production is prevalent in at least 17 countries. “There’s a lot of cotton out there, but when you opt for Fairtrade cotton goods you are empowering small-scale farmers and pushing the industry to become sustainable.” The Fairtrade Minimum Price is the minimum that producers are paid when selling their products through Fairtrade. This covers the average costs of sustainably producing their goods and acts as a safety net when market prices drop. Producers can get the market price when this is higher and can always negotiate for more. The Fairtrade Premium is an extra sum of money in addition to the selling price that farmers or workers receive to invest in their communities. Representatives elected by locals decide how to spend theFairtrade Premium. These investments include projects like improving their farming, businesses, or health and education in the community. The Fairtrade Standards are the requirements that producers and the businesses who buy their goods have to meet for a product to be Fairtrade certified. These standards ensure fairer terms of trade between farmers and buyers, protect workers’ rights, and provide the framework for producers to build thriving, sustainable farms and organizations.

https://terrathread.com/pages/global-organic-textile-standard,"Country/region Country/region GLOBAL ORGANIC TEXTILE STANDARD All Terra Thread bags are produced in line with the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS). Our products meet GOTS’ strict social and environmental criteria across the entire supply chain, including adherence to strong labor provisions and prohibited use of toxic chemicals. Simply put, organic cotton is grown without toxic pesticides or insecticides and that is what makes it different from others. Conventionally grown cotton is sprayed with numerous chemicals that soak into the plant and the surrounding soil, which is then ingested by the farmers. When pesticides are sprayed, toxic runoff takes place, which causes toxic chemicals seep into our drinking water supply, rivers, lakes, and other sensitive ecosystems. Long-term exposure to these chemicals can be detrimental to people's health and can have major impacts on their lives and well-being. Research shows that conventionally grown cotton uses more insecticides than any other crop in the world. According to Organic Trade Association (OTA), cotton used $4.2 billion worth of pesticides in 2017, accounting for 6.35% by value of all the plant protection chemicals sold that year, including 12.34% of all insecticide sales and 3.94% of herbicide sales. The standard prohibits the use of toxic chemicals during the processing stages and includes strong labor provisions as well as prohibition of child labor. GOTS covers the processing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, trading, and distribution of products sold as GOTS certified. When you purchase a GOTS Certified product, it means that the product has met strict environmental and social criteria during its entire supply chain. Social criteria based on the key norms of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) must be met by all processors and manufacturers. They must have a social compliance management with defined elements in place to ensure that the social criteria can be met. For adequate implementation and assessment of the following social criteria topics the listed applicable key conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) have to be taken as the relevant basis for interpretation.

Your purchase also supports Feeding America's campaign to end hunger by helping donate meals to kids and families in need. I absolutely love this bag! It is very well made and the perfect size. Sometimes I do not need to carry a large bag and this fits all my essentials. I can fit my phone, wallet, keys, and sunglasses in it. Plus I really like that I can wear it as a fanny pack or a sling bag (however I would like it to be a bit smaller when wearing it around my waist). I am super happy with my purchase! As Advertised I love the color of this fanny bag, however, it is not made for athletic/toned waists! The strap won't adjust to a smaller waist so it kind of sags a bit. I love that it's organic! This was exactly what I was after for a fanny pack to use as sling bag. Big enough to hold a small wallet, phone, earbuds, sunglasses, and other little essentials, but small enough that even when full it sits pretty flush with your body whether on front or back and doesn't look weird or obstruct your arm movement. (Probably not as flat as a bag that is meant only for sling use, but I like that I have the fanny pack option so that's a tradeoff I chose.)  Love the metal hooks and durable, natural material in some great color options! I would love a darker eggplant purple shade if that's ever added. The Cadera Fanny Pack is a thoughtfully designed bag that blends practicality with sustainability. It keeps your essentials close and your hands-free when on the go. Wear it on your hip or as a sling bag. Fanny packs come in a variety of materials. The Cadera Fanny Pack is made from certified organic cotton, offering a more sustainable and stylish option. There’s no one way to wear it. You can keep it classic around your waist, sling it across your chest for a modern touch, or wear it over your shoulder for a laid-back look. An ideal fanny pack is compact yet roomy enough to hold your must-haves. The Cadera Fanny Pack sized H6 x W9 x D2.5 inches is designed to carry your daily essentials without weighing you down.

I’m a grad student and normally use a backpack to carry all my school stuff (laptop, books, water, pencils, etc) but recently I’ve been studying at local coffee shops and preferred to carry my things in a tote bag. This bag has been great! The material feels thick and sturdy, the inner pockets are perfect for my Mac and Hydroflask, and the front pocket is big enough to hold my glasses, pencil pouch, wallet, and AirPods. I usually use the back pocket to carry an extra bag for groceries or my phone while I’m walking. I only wish this bag had a zipper for the main compartment. The lavender color is also kind of blue-purple, but I really like it. I ordered 5 executive tote bags for the girls in my family for Christmas. I know they will love the quality and size. They are sturdy and can easily hold laptops and much more. They have a wide range of colors but I was conservative going with Charcoal and Black which I’m sure they will like. The shipping was fast giving me time to wrap them for Christmas. 
I would definitely order them again! I hope you make more shoulder bags! Love it! Love that it’s not leather and made by a caring company i needed a bag for work that would fit my laptop and all of the junk that i carry regularly -- and it does just that! it's super sturdy and the material is great quality. i love the water bottle pocket, and the front zip for my smaller items. the back pocket is perfect for keeping my umbrella! i'm so pleased with my purchase!

https://terrathread.com/blogs/news/ways-to-celebrate-earth-day,"Country/region Country/region Earth Day is much more than one day on the calendar; it is a time for us to share a moment collectively and think about our planet. It is a wonderful opportunity to announce WE CARE. You might be wondering, ‘When is Earth Day?’ It's always on April 22nd. But knowing 'What day is Earth Day?' is not enough; it is crucial to understand why we need it. The idea for Earth Day started because people saw problems with our environment. Such issues like pollution and global warming still exist within society. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the organization confirmed that the year 2023 was the hottest year on record, with global temperatures exceeding averages by 1.45°C, emphasizing the necessity of tackling climate change. That's why Earth Day is CRITICAL. It serves as a reminder that any little steps taken by people, no matter how small, can go a long way toward a better planet. From tree planting and waste reduction to educating others, we all have our parts. In this blog post, we are going to discuss fun and engaging ways to celebrate Earth Day. We'll look at how we can celebrate Earth Day with things we can all do. These tips will inspire you, whether you are a teacher who wants to engage your students, a parent searching for fun “Earth Day for kids” activities, or simply someone interested in making a difference. Let’s strive to make this Earth Day a special day. Earth Day is a day to focus on activities and learn about protecting the environment. It provides an opportunity to contemplate why the earth requires such profound care. This global event encourages individuals to reflect on the changes they can implement to impact the environment positively and improve their daily lives. Simple actions like reducing plastic use or actively participating in environmental initiatives are positive steps in the right direction. Earth Day reminds us that we all share the responsibility of keeping our planet healthy. Earth Day is an annual event that raises awareness about environmental issues. It started in 1970 when millions of Americans protested against pollution and demanded stronger environmental laws. Today, Earth Day is a big movement that brings people together from all over the world to teach, inspire, and encourage everyone to protect the planet. It has led to many progressive eco-friendly actions and important environmental legislation around the globe. Why do we observe Earth Day? The simple answer is that issues like global warming, deforestation, and pollution are endangering the Earth. Approximately 9.7 billion cigarette butts are discarded every year; 4 billion of those horrifically stay and poison the waterways, contributing to about 20% of all United States litter. On the other hand, various trees are planted all across the globe in different quantities, but the number being planted to the amount being consumed is drastically low. 10 million hectares worth of trees are consumed every year, while only half of that is replanted, resulting in negative forest population growth. Western Europe, previously rich in green landscapes with 80% covered in forests, now has just 34% left. Meanwhile, 460 million metric tons of plastic waste every year is astonishing. By the year 2050, there is a chance for plastic to outweigh fish, which would spell doomsday for ocean animals. Earth Day is a gift to the world for reevaluating how we solve various problems to ensure a better ecological future not just for today's society but also for generations to follow. It calls for attention and encourages people to take actions like afforestation, cleaning, waste management, passing laws on environmental protection, and many other activities that have a positive effect on climate and help the world we share. The more people participate, the more positive changes we will be able to achieve to ensure the well-being of future generations. In the absence of action and consequences, those issues will get more and more difficult to deal with, which in turn will destroy the air we breathe, the water we use for drinking, and the planet we live on. Earth Day serves as a reminder that we still have time to make a change—IF WE ACT NOW.  Trees play a crucial role in cleaning the air, supporting wildlife, and creating healthier environments. Forests provide habitats for 80% of the world’s land species, helping wildlife thrive. Urban reforestation can also improve mental health (studies indicate that office workers who see green spaces feel better). Trees even release phytoncides, natural compounds that reduce stress, boost immunity, and improve heart health. Plus, adding just 10% more green cover in cities can lower surface temperatures by 2.2°C, creating cooler and healthier spaces. Here are a few ways you can help: The term “fast fashion” has gained a lot of popularity lately, but its impact on the environment is a growing concern. A wonderful alternative to buying new clothes is organizing a clothing swap with loved ones. Here are 3 steps for a successful clothing swap: Earth Day is one of the best days of the year. On Earth Day, we can all set small promises that help our planet. The changes need not be drastic; even simple things in our day-to-day activities can help a lot. You can start small by reducing plastic/plastic product usage, using a reusable water bottle, or carrying a shopping bag. Another idea is to save water. Turn off the water tap after brushing your teeth, take shorter showers, and fix any leaks. If you use the car often, try going car-free once a week and walking, biking, or taking public transport. You can also lessen your carbon footprint by reducing meat consumption. Meat is one of the highest producers of GHG emissions, so even going a few days without eating animal products can be a great help. These steps may seem small when done by one person, but imagine the effect if we all did them. So, what’s your eco-friendly promise this Earth Day? Recycling is one of the best things we can do to save the planet. But, unfortunately, the majority of us don’t do it properly. Earth Day serves as a perfect reminder to change our habits, and having these tips can truly help make a difference. Let’s make these small efforts collectively and enjoy a more sustainable future. Purchasing items from the supermarket requires significant transport logistics. During this transportation, the environment suffers from an increased carbon footprint. When possible, opt for locally-grown food. It aids local economies, supports farmers, and decreases transportation-related emissions. Buy only what you need and compost the rest of your food scraps. Choosing local food is an incredibly effective way to support your community while celebrating Earth Day. Organizing a community clean-up is one of the most powerful ways to celebrate Earth Day while also making a visible difference. You can also educate other people around you about keeping public spaces clean and minimizing waste. It’s rewarding to witness the results of your hard work! You can also partner with local schools, offices, or environmental groups to expand participation. Using fewer cars is great for the planet. However, we understand that going car-free is not always easy, especially in the U.S., where over 66% of Americans commute to work using their own cars. One solution is to encourage carpooling or the use of public transit when possible. Cars contribute to air pollution and climate change by emitting harmful gasses. Choosing sustainable transportation can significantly reduce your carbon footprint which makes a difference. You can participate in an eco-friendly way by: Get involved with local activists who make an effort to protect the environment. These groups focus on issues like pollution, deforestation, and climate change. Join them to become an environmental advocate and make a difference. Search for local organizations, businesses, or government offices sponsoring clean-up programs, tree planting exercises, or educational sessions. Attend their meetings, volunteer, or donate if you can. Promoting their activities on social media helps spread the word too! Support local activists to help work toward a greener and healthier planet. Plastic straws, cutlery, containers, and bags are easy to dispose of but leave enormous amounts of waste in their wake. Instead of disposable items, start using reusable ones, such as water bottles, bags, and even utensils. Refusing plastic straws or opting for an organic cotton tote bag bag can do wonders in decreasing plastic pollution. Many restaurants and cafes also offer incentives for customers who bring their containers. Zero-waste living benefits the earth and sets a good example for others to follow as well. With each effort made in avoiding single-use plastic disposables, our planet becomes cleaner and greener. Every voice counts! Take action by advocating for representatives to pass laws that protect nature and reduce pollution. Many governments are now focusing on sustainability, but stronger action is needed. With more public demand and pressure, it can lead to better laws and legislation surrounding climate change, waste management, and clean energy. Taking Earth Day into consideration for children is equally vital. Kids should start learning how to protect their environment at an early age. There are numerous Earth Day activities for kids that are both engaging and instructive. Simple lessons like how to recycle or conserve water can greatly impact creating a sustainable future.  For Earth Day, it's a great idea to teach kids how to care for the planet. Hands-on Earth Day Activities will facilitate children's learning about nature, sustainability, and recycling, all while enjoying themselves. These activities will enhance the spirit of Earth Day and make it special and productive, whether at home or in the classroom. Kids learn best through play, making it easier for them to grasp essential concepts about the environment. These games make Earth Day for kids more entertaining while imparting invaluable lessons about caring for the planet. Earth Day activities can also be done in a group setting, making them ideal for schools and families. These activities foster collaboration while promoting environmental stewardship.  Changing our daily habits in small ways can greatly help the environment. Implementing a few practices in our everyday lives can aid waste management, energy expenditure, and the preservation of our planet. Small changes may seem minor, but they add up to create a huge difference over time. Following Earth Day tips and making eco-friendly choices fosters a better future. Sustainable living is not a one-day activity—it involves making an effort every day to protect the planet. All put together, small actions can form new habits. A little effort today goes a long way toward creating a healthy and green planet! “Earth Day” is an encouragement for us to factor in how every tiny action can collectively contribute to the protection of our precious planet. Using less plastic, conserving water, and planting more trees are simple yet impactful activities. On a larger scale, volunteering for community clean-ups or switching to environmentally sustainable brands to support eco-friendly companies reap even greater rewards. Let’s make every day “Earth Day” with smarter choices. Ask your friends and family to join in and help take care of the Earth. You can share our Earth Day blog with others to inspire them too. Small efforts add up, and together, we can make the world a cleaner and greener place!  Earth Day is celebrated on April 22 every year. Try planting a tree, starting a compost bin, or reducing your plastic use. Check out the ideas above, and if you’re looking for something different, try hosting a zero-waste picnic, starting a neighborhood garden, or making DIY eco-friendly gifts. They can participate in clean-ups, learn about recycling, and do fun eco-friendly crafts. Plant trees, recycle, reduce plastic use, walk or bike instead of driving, clean up litter, support local farmers, save electricity, advocate for policies, use reusable items, and educate others. Every small action counts. Start with one sustainable habit! Leave a comment Please note, comments need to be approved before they are published.

https://terrathread.com/blogs/news/new-year-resolutions-for-the-greater-good,"Country/region Country/region Human conducts has left this crumbling boulder of a planet we name Home unhappy with apprehensions—  Our precious Earth is highly dynamic, and the whole species of plants & animals are becoming extinct without humans having a chance to appreciate them. We’ve invited industrial pollutants to invade the air, water bodies, food, medications, furnishings, textiles, businesses, and houses. Natural resources such as fresh water, fertile land, and forests are becoming depleted, destroyed, or harder to come by as a result of ever-growing consumer demands. As we face growing environmental challenges, embracing sustainable practices is more crucial than ever. Beyond the statistics, it’s about protecting the heart of life itself: the songs of birds, the whisper of leaves, and the thriving beauty beneath the waves. Each of us has a role to play, and together, our collective actions can create a world that honors and cares for nature instead of depleting it. Let’s make choices today that leave a lasting, positive impact for generations to come.   Vote, but as an aware voter— educate yourself on the societal challenges and the candidates running for elections.  Are the leaders in your local neighborhood addressing climate change action as urgently as the general public? When campaign season arrives, have a good awareness of the ongoing community problems and the candidates who want your vote. Voting is a fundamental opportunity to bring changes— but you won't be able to exercise your authority effectively unless you’re fully informed. Plan ahead of time to research how a vote in any single angle means for you and your community members. Your vote can drive high-level actions--- Become a member of a climate activist organization to encourage collective, mass movement. Changes at the government level can only be made if we, the citizens, demonstrate our commitment to environmental protection and empowerment. Research, educate yourself on global issues, discuss, read, and finally, make doubly sure you get out there and vote when it's your turn— the government impacts your life, and your vote makes a difference! Among the most significant New Year's Resolutions for most people is to eat healthy. We commit to changing our eating habits, only to find ourselves running in a circle year after year (of course, there are exceptions). So this year, why not stay true to it? Challenge yourself to eat more responsibly. To begin with, shop for products that are manufactured according to fair labor standards. This implies everything— from the smallest edible to the largest. Look for the Fairtrade label on a product. If you’re not sure, do your research about the ethical manufactures committed to sustainability. And wherever possible buy locally or organically grown produce.  Speaking of ‘possible’— restrict your meat consumption if at all possible. The cattle sector is a huge cause of pollution, and most traditional livestock are reared cruelly. If you consume meat every now and then, buy from local vendors who practice regenerative livestock farming. Ethical eating will not only  establish healthier consumption habits but also induce a sense of belonging to the community. Charitable contributions are an excellent means to support numerous organizations all across the world fighting against hunger, diseases, and poverty. Commit to being efficient as possible when donating to your choice of organization in 2022. Do your homework— find out which charity/ non-profit organizations are making a real difference in the world. You can support them in their quest to make the world a better place by donating your dollars. The world uses 160,000 plastic bags per second— just for about 12 minutes on average. That’s 100 million tons or more of plastic trash in one year. In the meantime, plastics have a landfill lifespan of around 1,000 years, which is highly problematic for the world.  So what can you do about it in 2022? Commit to carrying reusable cotton tote. Really— it’s as simple as that! As part of your New Year’s resolutions, you can also challenge yourself to go a day without plastic and then eventually increase the days. While it can be tough to suddenly ditch the single-use plastics we are accustomed to for most of our lives, taking such drastic steps opens our eyes to the severity of the plastic crisis. The biggest takeaway is that once we eventually start living our days without single-use plastics, we begin to understand how we can, once and for all, stop them from playing any part in our lives. We buy fast fashion clothes significantly more than we need (and use), only to discard them. Every year, an estimated 92 million tonnes of textile waste gets generated— comparable to a garbage truck filled with garments ending up in landfills per second.  In this coming new year, resolve not to buy or buy into fast fashion. Alternatively, consider sustainably made textile products including organic cotton canvas backpack, bed sheets, t-shirts and more. They are eco-friendly, sustainable, and safer for the health— free of chemicals and pesticides. This also helps prevent perfectly wonderful apparel from ending up in landfills. The fast fashion industry is extremely polluted, resource-intensive, unsustainable, and inequitable— take a vow to make your new year free of fast fashion. Sustainability is not just a trend; it’s a lifestyle choice that can significantly impact our planet for the better. This year, let’s challenge ourselves to rethink the way we shop, wear, and consume. Prioritize buying less but better. Opt for timeless wardrobe pieces that last longer and don’t go out of style. Embrace second-hand shopping or clothing swaps, which not only save money but also reduce waste. Additionally, look into brands that practice ethical manufacturing, use recycled materials, and pay fair wages to workers. Be curious— ask questions about the origin of your clothing and whether it aligns with your values. Sustainable fashion is more than avoiding fast fashion; it’s about celebrating creativity while respecting the environment and human rights. Each purchase you make is a vote for the kind of world you want to live in. Make it count by turning your wardrobe into a statement of care and responsibility. We need to proactively combat the repercussions of climate change. Living on the hopes that leaders will take action to fight the climate issues is not enough to reverse climate change. We, as responsible citizens, should do it for ourselves by committing to reduce our carbon footprint in 2022. And you can start with reducing meat consumption, walking and biking, taking public transit when possible, and making an effort to live and consume the minimalist way in every part of our lives. You don't necessarily have to take a worldwide approach when deciding how to leave a positive mark in the world. Every little effort you undertake contributes greatly to long-term changes. The most important resolution you can adopt in the new year is striving to take conscious decisions— decisions that serve the greater good. Remember that every significant change starts with a little individual effort. Never discount your power as a global citizen— harness it to help the world transform visions into reality in 2025!

https://anchalproject.org/pages/our-story,"Design is our passion, and using design to impact lives has become our purpose. Anchal is a non-profit social enterprise that leverages design and collaboration to create sustainable, income-generating careers in eco-friendly textiles for marginalized women in India. “Anchal” is a Hindi word meaning both shelter and the decorative edge of a sari used to provide comfort and protection to loved ones. Anchal provides valuable skills training in textile production and fair-wage employment to women.  The holistic program includes education workshops, health services, and community benefits, fostering financial independence and creativity.  The artisans create award-wining handmade products that blend traditional techniques with eco-friendly methods, minimizing environmental impact and championing sustainability in the fashion industry. A human-centered design process balances the artisan’s well-being and our customer's needs, resulting in beautiful artistry. When women have employment opportunities, they empower themselves and create generational change. Steadfast dedication to using eco-friendly materials and processes, combined with long-term community investment, ensures a positive impact. Collaborating with a trusted Indian NGO and manufacturer to lead operations builds trust and creates long-term impact. Anchal believes that sustainable impact is most successfully driven by local leadership. We partner with an established and trusted non-governmental organization (NGO) and a social enterprise that is dedicated to providing careers in textile production for marginalized and exploited communities of women in Rajasthan, India. The Indian organizations are the face of Anchal. They successfully run operations, artisan recruitment, training, production, and monitor impact. Their connection and dedication to the community provides deep knowledge, builds trust, and gives experienced guidance, thereby ensuring the program is informed by the artisans, meets their diverse needs, and fosters long-term impact. Anchal was established in 2010 by sisters Colleen and Maggie Clines. With backgrounds in architecture, they recognized the transformative power of design in addressing social and environmental issues.  Their journey began after Colleen's eye-opening experience with an NGO in India during a 2009 Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) graduate class trip, where she learned about the need for alternative livelihood programs for women in the sex trade. Meanwhile, Maggie explored the profound impact of design as a research assistant.  Motivated by their shared interests and passions, they raised $400 to start Anchal, providing the first collective of artisans with sewing machines, materials, and stipends. This marked the official establishment of Anchal as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in 2010, a status that underscores our commitment to transparency and accountability. best seller

Anchal excels in partnering with brands and designers to create unique collections that seamlessly blend artisanal craftsmanship with our distinctive design expertise, delivering a compelling story and product to our clients.  Our custom collaborations span a variety of industries, from home decor and fashion to hospitality and museum gift stores. We've proudly worked with esteemed clients such as Bloomingdale's, The Guggenheim Store, Madewell, Brooklinen, and Ace Hotels. Explore some of our favorite projects below. Anchal crafted a limited-edition organic cotton quilt exclusively for Bloomingdale’s. Inspired by the storied tradition of Indian madras designs, the contemporary checkered pattern brought a modern twist to heritage. These exclusive quilts were showcased in 12 Bloomingdale’s stores nationwide and also available online. For its second collaboration with the Guggenheim Museum Store, Anchal was invited to honor the works of Brooklyn-born artist Alex Katz through an exclusive, limited-edition capsule collection. Drawing inspiration from Katz’s iconic use of bold color, refined compositions, and economy of line, the collection was influenced by his paintings The Red Smile and Yellow Tree 1. It featured an array of products, including quilts, tote bags, weekender bags, scarves, and quilted chore jackets. Anchal was commissioned to create custom textile art for Bunkhouse’s Hotel Genevieve, drawing inspiration from Louisville, Kentucky's vernacular imagery. The piece’s design is an abstracted steamboat wheel, crafted with  a colorful array of patchworked panels embellished  with kantha stitching. These vibrant framed artworks are showcased in 118 hotel rooms. Anchal created custom laundry bags for Maison de la Luz, Ace’s luxury boutique hotel in the heart of New Orleans. Designed for both form and function, these bespoke items were crafted to complement the local art featured in each room, enhancing the hotel’s unique aesthetic. In 2018, Anchal partnered with the Guggenheim Museum to design an exclusive capsule collection inspired by the modernist work of painter, Hilma af Klint. The named Spiral and Radial collection featured two quilts, scarves, tote bags, and a kimono jacket. These pieces incorporated abstract geometric forms and shades of brilliant color that exuded Hilma’s powerful aesthetic. The Brooklinen x Anchal Collection was a limited edition of handcrafted, custom-made quilted bedding, throws, and pillows, exclusively designed for the Brooklyn-based luxury linens company. This collection seamlessly blended Anchal's signature contemporary quilting techniques with Brooklinen's minimalist aesthetic, creating museum-worthy yet functional decor that combines calm and comfort. For the launch of Madewell's Fair Trade Certified collection of denim, in February 2019, they selected three of Anchal's organic-cotton quilt designs to decorate the store windows of 120+ stores across the United States and London. In conjunction with the window displays, our contemporary home goods and travel bags became available to Madewell customers via the company’s website. Anchal partnered with CAUSEBOX (now Alltrue), a subscription box featuring socially conscious and sustainable goods, to design the exclusive Winter 2017 box. Drawing inspiration from our Naari quilt, we transformed its warm pattern into the perfect cozy design for the boxes. Anchal brought James Beard nominee Chef Ouita Michel's dream apron to life for Holly Hill Inn. This durable and comfortable apron features long strings for tying in the front and multiple pockets, including a chef’s pocket embroidered with their beautiful bouquet garni design. In the Summer of 2019, we collaborated with IBU Movement to create a one-of-a-kind sustainable look. The ensemble included our first-ever hand-stitched dress and slide shoe with a coordinating shawl-collar jacket. All three pieces were designed in partnership with IBU’s team and intricately hand-stitched from certified organic cotton by Anchal artisans. Urban Outfitters' Anchal x Urban Renewal 2013 Fall Collection featured an exclusive eleven-piece line of one-of-a-kind apparel, including jackets, dresses, tops, shorts, and skirts. Each piece incorporated elements of our hand-stitched Kantha quilts made from vintage saris. This collaboration uniquely fused design, fashion, craftsmanship, and women’s empowerment into every garment. Developed in collaboration with actor America Ferrera following her visit to India for Nicholas Kristof’s PBS documentary, Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide, the Didi Connection united women globally through the sales of 600 scarves. In India, women affectionately call each other ""didi,"" meaning sister in Hindi. By purchasing a unique Didi scarf, customers supported their Indian sisters.

https://anchalproject.org/pages/sustainable-process,"Designing Change Stitch by Stitch Anchal’s designs seamlessly blend traditional, handmade crafts with contemporary aesthetics and eco-friendly values, revolutionizing textiles for the modern home and wardrobe. We honor the past and embrace the sustainable fashion movement by hand-stitching and printing all of our products while using sustainably sourced materials such as vintage fabrics, certified organic cotton, and non-toxic dyes. The kantha stitch is a simple running stitch that serves both utilitarian and decorative purposes. In its most basic form, it holds multiple layers of fabric together. When used decoratively, it can overlap, meander, and fill shapes with intricate designs. Originating in West Bengal, the kantha stitch is a culturally significant art form in India, with roots tracing back to ancient times. At Anchal, we pride ourselves on offering the highest quality kantha stitching on the market. Our meticulous stitching is both thoughtful and precise, using luxurious embroidery thread to create the softest plush finish. We push the boundaries of contemporary kantha techniques by incorporating bold graphic motifs paired with a refined color palette, invoking a sense of casual sophistication. Patchwork involves sewing together small pieces of fabric to create a larger design. In India, patchwork has a rich history deeply intertwined with the country's textile traditions. Originally a practical technique to repurpose worn fabrics, it evolved into an artistic craft featuring bold colors, geometric patterns, and detailed embroidery, reflecting India's diverse cultural heritage and skilled craftsmanship. Anchal enhances these traditional methods with modern aesthetics, resulting in products that are both beautiful and meaningful. By using patchwork, Anchal not only showcases the artistry of the craft but also promotes sustainability by using organic cotton and repurposing fabric remnants into high-quality items. Block printing is a remarkable traditional craft where intricate designs are carved into wooden blocks and used to apply ink or dye onto fabric.  At Anchal, this art form and color mixing are performed by a women led team, an extraordinary accomplishment in a field traditionally dominated by men in India. This empowers women artisans to break barriers and thrive in a male-dominated industry. Our designs blend traditional motifs with simple geometric patterns, creating a balanced aesthetic that honors cultural heritage while offering contemporary appeal. Embroidery is the art of decorating fabric or other materials using a needle to apply thread. This craft involves various stitches to create detailed designs, patterns, and imagery on textiles. Anchal artisans, known for their expertise in this field, specialize in a running kantha stitch to create intricate and elaborate designs. To enhance their work, these artisans often incorporate other traditional stitching techniques such as cross-stitch, backstitch, and chain stitch. By combining these different methods, simple fabric transforms into a work of art with added texture, depth, and complexity. Who made your piece? Check the tag for the hand-sewn name of our talented artisan. Each artisan takes immense pride in this personal touch and the intricate craftsmanship stitched into every piece.  Senior Artisan Neetu expressed, ""I know that I will never be able to travel the world, but now my name will!"" When you choose Anchal products made with organic cotton, recycled materials, and non-toxic dyes it is an eco-friendly and responsible choice that reduces harmful chemical use, conserves water, minimizes pollution, decreases waste, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. We proudly source vintage cotton and silk saris that we then upcycle into a variety of  one-of-a-kind textile pieces. This practice helps minimize the environmental impact of textile production by reducing fabric waste and conserving resources. It also preserves cultural heritage by keeping traditional patterns and prints in use through kantha quilting. All new fabric Anchal sources is certified organic cotton. This sustainable farming technique reduces water consumption, supports soil health and is grown without harmful pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. By avoiding toxic chemicals, organic cotton promotes safer working conditions and ensures healthier end products. Additionally, its use helps minimize the carbon footprint of textile production, contributing to a more environmentally friendly and ethical fashion industry. We use non-toxic dyes, free from harmful chemicals like AZO compounds, to ensure environmental sustainability and consumer safety. This practice not only reduces the ecological footprint of textile production by minimizing water pollution but protects consumers from potential allergic reactions, skin sensitivities, or other prolonged health issues associated with conventional dyes.  We prioritize minimal waste in our product design, utilizing fabric scraps from our production to create new, useful items, effectively upcycling hundreds of pounds of fabric. Embracing zero waste principles, Anchal not only reduces landfill waste but also conserves resources and promotes sustainable consumption practices in the textile industry. Anchal’s designs draw inspiration from India’s rich vernacular architecture, heritage artwork, and the unique perspectives of the artisans. Guided by their creativity and the preferences of our customers, we sketch numerous designs and experiment with diverse patterns and colors. The Project Assistant team and artisans play a pivotal role in designing the vintage products by selecting impeccable color and pattern combinations that embody ultimate artistry. This collaborative process ensures each piece is meticulously crafted and uniquely created to complement your style. best seller

Each purchase in turn supports her family's basic needs and children's education. This impact extends to the 180 artisans and 24 Project Assistants supported by Anchal’s program.  ""Education is the most important thing in life. It opens doors of knowledge. If you can read and write, you feel strong. I will do anything to get my children the best education possible.  I was the oldest of six siblings. My parents were extremely poor, and we could barely afford two square meals for the eight of us. My parents were out most of the time working as daily wage construction laborers and I had to look after my little sisters and brother. I missed out on what many children consider normal childhood experiences, such as playing with friends and attending school. Instead, my days were filled with caregiving responsibilities and the constant worry about our next meal. What I have missed in my life, I am determined to make sure that my children get. Most importantly a good quality education! Thanks to my full-time job at Anchal, I can send my two daughters and one son to a private school. I am able to pay their school fees, uniforms, and books. My husband is also supportive of my big dream for our children, and I am grateful for that support. Many of my fellow artisan women struggle to get support from their families. Anchal and the leadership team provide great inspiration for me. There is  a great atmosphere of equality and I finally feel respected and appreciated for what I do, and for who I am. It is so wonderful."" Inadequate access to education and employment disproportionately affects impoverished  women worldwide, often forcing them into exploitation. Research indicates that women given employment opportunities are 90% more likely than men to invest in crucial areas such as education, shelter, food, and health. Anchal measures our investment through economic growth, health access, children’s education, leadership, and market access. Anchal’s programs demonstrate that systematically addressing employment inequality empowers women to uplift themselves and contribute to positive change within their families and communities, leaving a lasting generational impact. Anchal artisans exemplify this transformation: Gulshan built her own home, Renu provided her family with safe drinking water, Shama covered her son’s surgery expenses, and Neetu sent her daughters to college. It is clear that Anchal's artisans uplift themselves and foster positive, lasting change. ""I remember my life with a great deal of pain.  My family circumstances led me to a very undignified life where daily abuse and exploitation were a daily experience.  I was so sad. I was on the verge of a mental breakdown and often had thoughts of ending my life. Then everything got worse when I married. It was a marriage of compromise, and my husband was not sympathetic to my past or physical and mental health. Eventually, we had two wonderful children, but I could never provide the life for them that I wanted. Then, by chance, I came to know about the community mobilization drive to enroll women in a skill-building program called Anchal. I was so depressed that I did not even want to try anything but, with patience and a lot of affection, I was convinced to join. And that was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I joined Anchal. Walking into Anchal is something I look forward to every day. There is a very lively and positive atmosphere. I dress well, I am healthy and the same can be said for my family. Every day I work hard to make sure my children do not face the difficulties I have faced in life. There are good and bad people in this world and after spending most of my life with bad people, I have finally found good people. There is a different life out there for us all if we just try. I am so grateful and proud to say that I am a happy person today."" best seller

 Online ads We use online advertising to keep you aware of what we’re up to and to help you find our products. Like many
    companies, we may target boohoo banners and ads to you when you use other websites and apps, based on your Contact,
    Technical, Usage and Profile Data. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and a
    range of advertising technologies such as web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers, as well as
    specific services offered by some sites and social networks, such as Facebook’s Custom Audience Service. Our use of analytics and targeted advertising tools We use a range of analytics and targeted advertising tools to display relevant website content on our website and
    online advertisements on other websites and apps (as described above) to you, deliver relevant content to you in
    marketing communications (where applicable), and to measure the effectiveness of the advertising provided. For
    example, we use tools such as Google Analytics to analyse Google's interest-based advertising data and/or
    third-party audience data (such as age, marital status, life event, gender and interests) to target and improve our
    marketing campaigns, marketing strategies and website content. We may also use tools provided by other third
    parties, such as Facebook, Content Square, Adroll, Responsys, Criteo and Bing to perform similar tasks, using your
    Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data. In order to opt out of targeted advertising you need to disable your ‘cookies’ in your browser settings
    (see Cookie Policy for details) or
    opt-out of the relevant third-party Ad Settings. For
    example, you can opt-out of the Google Display Advertising
        Features using their . As an added privacy measure, you can also use the . Google will use data for ad personalisation when a customer provides consent. Please see Google’s Privacy & Terms

    processing of your personal data. Request correction of your personal data You are entitled to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete. You can update your personal
    data at any time by logging into your account and updating your details
    directly, or by emailing us at DPO@boohoo.com. Request erasure of your personal data  This enables you to request that boohoo delete your personal data, where there is no good reason for us continuing to
    process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal
    reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. Request restriction of processing of your personal data You have a right to ask boohoo to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain scenarios, for example if
    you want us to establish the accuracy of the data, or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to
    verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Where processing is restricted, we are allowed to
    retain sufficient information about you to ensure that the restriction is respected in future. Request the transfer of your personal data You have the right to obtain a digital copy of your personal data or request the transfer of your personal data to

    your data which override your rights and freedoms. Request human intervention for automated decision making and profiling You have the right to request human intervention where we are carrying out automated decision making when processing
    your personal data. This form of processing is permitted where it is necessary as part of our contract with you,

    keep you updated. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure
    your right to exercise any of the above rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not

    DPO@boohoo.com. You also have the right to make a complaint to the ICO (the data protection regulator in the UK) or
    (if you are located in the European Union) any other competent supervisory authority in your country of residence (a
    list of supervisory authorities can be found here: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en). We
    would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with
    your concerns before you approach the ICO or any other supervisory authority, so please do contact us in the first
    instance. Your data and countries outside of the UK The personal data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the UK using
    legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. It may also be processed by staff operating
    outside the UK who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the
    fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We will take
    all steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.  Whenever we transfer personal data outside the UK, we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by
    ensuring appropriate safeguards, as required by law, are in place. We will be able to transfer your personal data to
    countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data. More information can
    be found here: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers/
    Otherwise, we may use specific contractual clauses approved for use in the UK which give personal data the same
    protection as it has in in the UK. More Information about this can be found on the ICO’s website.
 We will keep your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) it was provided for and to meet
    our legal obligations. Further details of the periods for which we retain data are available on request. From time to time we may change this GDPR Addendum. If there are any significant changes we will post updates on our
    website, applications or let you know by email. We welcome feedback and are happy to answer any questions you may have about your data. Please send any questions, comments or requests for more information to our nominated representative and Data

    or more of the business purposes described below to the following categories of third parties:

    However, the use of advertising and analytics cookies on our Website is considered a “sale” of Personal Information
    as the term “sale” is broadly defined in the CPRA to include both monetary and other valuable consideration. Our
    “sale” is limited to our use of third-party advertising and analytics cookies and their use in providing behavioral
    advertising and their use in understanding how people use and interact with our website(s) and applications. Our
    “sales” of your Personal Information in this matter is subject to your right to opt-out of those sales (see Your

    advertising cookies and their use in providing you cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., advertising on other
    websites or in other mediums). When the recipients of your Personal Information disclosed for the purpose of
    cross-context behavioral advertising are also permitted to use your Personal Information to provide advertising to
    others, we also consider this disclosure as a “sale” for monetary or other valuable consideration under the CPRA.

    “sale” or “sharing” of their Personal Information can be found in Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of
    Your Personal Information.  The CPRA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section
    describes your CPRA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. You may exercise these rights yourself or
    through your Authorized Agent. For more information on how you or your Authorized Agent can exercise your rights,
    please see Exercising Your CPRA Privacy Rights. These rights include the right to: Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. You also have the right to opt-out of our sale or sharing of
    your personal data, as described further below.  You have the right to request that boohoo disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your
    Personal Information over the past 12 months (a “Right to Know” Consumer Request).  You also have the right to request that boohoo provide you with a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information
    that we have collected about you, including any Personal Information that we have created or otherwise received from
    a third-party about you (a “Data Portability” Consumer Request). You have the right to request that we correct any incorrect Personal Information about you to ensure that it is
    complete, accurate, and as current as possible. In addition to other methods you may have to exercise this right as
    described below, you may review and correct some Personal Information about yourself by logging into your account
    page and updating your details directly.  To exercise the rights described above, please submit a request (a “Consumer Request”) to us by either:  If you fail to make your Consumer Request in accordance with the ways described above, we may either treat your
    request as if it had been submitted with our methods described above or provide you with information on how to
    submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with your request.
    Only you, or your Authorized Agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a Consumer Request related to
    your Personal Information. To designate an Authorized Agent, see Authorized Agents below.
 All Consumer Requests must: We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or
    authority to make the request and confirm which Personal Information relates to you or the individual for whom you
    are making the request as their Authorized Agent.
    Making a Consumer Request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made
    through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information
    associated with that specific account.
    We will only use Personal Information provided in a Consumer Request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority
    to make the request.
    For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Your Choices Regarding our “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your
    Personal Information.
 You may authorize your agent to exercise your rights under the CPRA on your behalf by registering your agent with the
    California Secretary of State or by providing them with power of attorney to exercise your rights in accordance with
    applicable laws (an “Authorized Agent”). We may request that your Authorized Agent submit proof of identity and that
    they have been authorized exercise your rights on your behalf. We may deny a request from your Authorized Agent to
    exercise your rights on your behalf if they fail to submit adequate proof of identity or adequate proof that they
    have the authority to exercise your rights.
    In response to a Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Request, we will provide you with all relevant
    information we have collected or maintained about you on or after January 1, 2022, unless an exception applies. The
    response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For Data
    Portability Consumer Request, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable
    and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, such as CSV
    file(s) and/or PDF file(s).
    We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your Consumer Request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
    manifestly unfounded. We reserve the right to consider more than two (2) total Right to Know or Data Portability
    Consumer Requests (or combination of the two) in a twelve (12) month period to be repetitive and/or excessive and
    require a fee. If we determine that your Consumer Request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision
    and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
 As described above, our use of cookies is considered a “sale” under the CPRA. We do not otherwise sell your Personal
    Information for monetary consideration. If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not
    “sell” your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration at any time (the “right to opt-out”).
    We do not “sell” the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we
    receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of
    age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information
    “sales” may opt-out of future “sales” at any time.  If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not share your Personal Information for the
    purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, which is showing advertising on other websites or other media
    based on your browsing history with our websites and applications (the “right to opt-out”). We do not share the
    Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age for this purpose, unless we receive
    affirmative authorization from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian
    of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to our sharing of Personal Information for these
    purposes may opt-out of future such sharing at any time.  To exercise the right to opt-out of the “sale” and the “sharing” your Personal Information for the purposes of
    cross-context behavioral advertising, you may do so by any of the following: clicking the link below, adjusting your
    cookie preferences, or by configuring your browser to send us a privacy signal as described in more detail below.
    You may also opt-out of such “sales” and “sharing” by setting your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or
    to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do not consent to our use of cookies or select this
    setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our websites or applications or other websites. You can find
    more information about cookies at http://www.allaboutcookies.org and http://youronlinechoices.eu.  Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize Personal
    Information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into the sale of Personal Information at any time

Pros:
* Not made of plastic
* Appears to be good quality and durable Possible improvements: The bag is quite rough to the touch. The top handle is especially uncomfortable to use. I see complaints about it being a magnet for loose fibers and pet hair. If it's picking up microplastic fibers when I'm out and about, I'd be quite sad about that. You might consider selling an oil or wax treatment which should help with that issue, while also making the bag less rough to the touch and more water resistant. I would really appreciate more small pockets for organization purposes. A button+flap closure on the top pocket inside the bag would be nice too. Thanks for making this bag! I was so happy to find a backpack made with just canvas, no polyester or plastic, and ethically sourced. It's really good quality, and I love the color options, though I expect I'll need to get used to the firmer shoulder straps. Thank you! Terra Thread’s backpacks are made from organic cotton canvas.

* Not made of plastic
* Appears to be good quality and durable Possible improvements: The bag is quite rough to the touch. The top handle is especially uncomfortable to use. I see complaints about it being a magnet for loose fibers and pet hair. If it's picking up microplastic fibers when I'm out and about, I'd be quite sad about that. You might consider selling an oil or wax treatment which should help with that issue, while also making the bag less rough to the touch and more water resistant. I would really appreciate more small pockets for organization purposes. A button+flap closure on the top pocket inside the bag would be nice too. Thanks for making this bag! I was so happy to find a backpack made with just canvas, no polyester or plastic, and ethically sourced. It's really good quality, and I love the color options, though I expect I'll need to get used to the firmer shoulder straps. Thank you! Terra Thread’s backpacks are made from organic cotton canvas.

When you choose fair trade products, you are a part of the movement that promotes and support sustainability throughout the supply chain. I’m a grad student and normally use a backpack to carry all my school stuff (laptop, books, water, pencils, etc) but recently I’ve been studying at local coffee shops and preferred to carry my things in a tote bag. This bag has been great! The material feels thick and sturdy, the inner pockets are perfect for my Mac and Hydroflask, and the front pocket is big enough to hold my glasses, pencil pouch, wallet, and AirPods. I usually use the back pocket to carry an extra bag for groceries or my phone while I’m walking. I only wish this bag had a zipper for the main compartment. The lavender color is also kind of blue-purple, but I really like it. I ordered 5 executive tote bags for the girls in my family for Christmas. I know they will love the quality and size. They are sturdy and can easily hold laptops and much more. They have a wide range of colors but I was conservative going with Charcoal and Black which I’m sure they will like. The shipping was fast giving me time to wrap them for Christmas. 
I would definitely order them again! I hope you make more shoulder bags! Love it! Love that it’s not leather and made by a caring company i needed a bag for work that would fit my laptop and all of the junk that i carry regularly -- and it does just that! it's super sturdy and the material is great quality. i love the water bottle pocket, and the front zip for my smaller items. the back pocket is perfect for keeping my umbrella! i'm so pleased with my purchase!

When you choose fair trade products, you are a part of the movement that promotes and support sustainability throughout the supply chain. I’m a grad student and normally use a backpack to carry all my school stuff (laptop, books, water, pencils, etc) but recently I’ve been studying at local coffee shops and preferred to carry my things in a tote bag. This bag has been great! The material feels thick and sturdy, the inner pockets are perfect for my Mac and Hydroflask, and the front pocket is big enough to hold my glasses, pencil pouch, wallet, and AirPods. I usually use the back pocket to carry an extra bag for groceries or my phone while I’m walking. I only wish this bag had a zipper for the main compartment. The lavender color is also kind of blue-purple, but I really like it. I ordered 5 executive tote bags for the girls in my family for Christmas. I know they will love the quality and size. They are sturdy and can easily hold laptops and much more. They have a wide range of colors but I was conservative going with Charcoal and Black which I’m sure they will like. The shipping was fast giving me time to wrap them for Christmas. 
I would definitely order them again! I hope you make more shoulder bags! Love it! Love that it’s not leather and made by a caring company i needed a bag for work that would fit my laptop and all of the junk that i carry regularly -- and it does just that! it's super sturdy and the material is great quality. i love the water bottle pocket, and the front zip for my smaller items. the back pocket is perfect for keeping my umbrella! i'm so pleased with my purchase! Terra Thread’s work tote bag measures H16 x W14 x G4 inches in size and weighs about 1.3 lbs. It’s compact, lightweight, and roomy enough to carry all your daily essentials with ease. The Terra Thread work tote features a spacious main compartment, an inner laptop sleeve for devices up to 15 inches, a dedicated pocket for up to 32 oz water bottles (inside), a front exterior pocket, and back pockets. Yes, this work tote bag has a dedicated laptop compartment designed to fit laptops up to 15 inches securely and comfortably.

Ordered this mini backpack and was super happy with the quality of the fabric and the zippers! It washes well and air dries quickly! Also happy with the green color! And it looks super cute! Yay!!! It’s such a vibrant color turquoise, beautiful lightweight but sturdy canvas. I bought separately the matching color pencil case. It’s so perfect for me for college when I’m not carrying too much around. Otherwise I have the bigger Terra Thread backpack too and love it. The environmental consciousness of the brand appeals to me, but also how functional yet simplistic their well stitched heavy duty canvas products are. I feel like I can make them last years and years, but they look good too. :) Shipping was crazy fast and once I got the bag you could feel the difference in quality compared to others. I would definitely recommend this for someone who doesn’t like to carry around purses ! I got this over the summer for my kindergartener to use as his main school pack and it's been perfect! We sewed on a few patches. It fits his folder, lunchbox, water, and a sweater perfectly. Sweet little backpack—just the right size for a sketchbook and all the necessities. Love the orange! Our mini backpack is 13 inches tall, 10.5 inches wide, and 4 inches deep, with a total capacity of about 9 liters. It's compact yet spacious enough to fit your everydayessentials. Terra Thread’s mini backpack has a spacious main compartment along with an internal hanging pocket for small items. Plus, there’s a zippered external pocket for quick access to your essentials. Yes. It can hold a tablet or a compact laptop up to 14 inches, making it handy for work, school, or personal use. The backpack comes in a variety of shades, ranging from muted tones like sand dune to vibrant options like ruby red, so there’s something for every style preference. The mini backpack is made from 100% organic cotton canvas, and it is not water-resistant. But it’s built to withstand light moisture. For heavy rain, keep it sheltered to protect your items.  The mini backpacks are crafted from 100% organic cotton canvas and produced in Fair Trade Certified factories, ensuring ethical and eco-friendly practices.

Not too big, not too small, wearable on your hip or as a tiny sling bag—the Cadera Fanny Pack is ready to roll when you are. Pack your essentials in this eco-friendly fanny pack made with organic cotton canvas when you want to move through the day with your hands-free. Your purchase also supports Feeding America's campaign to end hunger by helping donate meals to kids and families in need. I absolutely love this bag! It is very well made and the perfect size. Sometimes I do not need to carry a large bag and this fits all my essentials. I can fit my phone, wallet, keys, and sunglasses in it. Plus I really like that I can wear it as a fanny pack or a sling bag (however I would like it to be a bit smaller when wearing it around my waist). I am super happy with my purchase! As Advertised I love the color of this fanny bag, however, it is not made for athletic/toned waists! The strap won't adjust to a smaller waist so it kind of sags a bit. I love that it's organic! This was exactly what I was after for a fanny pack to use as sling bag. Big enough to hold a small wallet, phone, earbuds, sunglasses, and other little essentials, but small enough that even when full it sits pretty flush with your body whether on front or back and doesn't look weird or obstruct your arm movement. (Probably not as flat as a bag that is meant only for sling use, but I like that I have the fanny pack option so that's a tradeoff I chose.)  Love the metal hooks and durable, natural material in some great color options! I would love a darker eggplant purple shade if that's ever added. The Cadera Fanny Pack is a thoughtfully designed bag that blends practicality with sustainability. It keeps your essentials close and your hands-free when on the go.

Pack your essentials in this eco-friendly fanny pack made with organic cotton canvas when you want to move through the day with your hands-free. Your purchase also supports Feeding America's campaign to end hunger by helping donate meals to kids and families in need. I absolutely love this bag! It is very well made and the perfect size. Sometimes I do not need to carry a large bag and this fits all my essentials. I can fit my phone, wallet, keys, and sunglasses in it. Plus I really like that I can wear it as a fanny pack or a sling bag (however I would like it to be a bit smaller when wearing it around my waist). I am super happy with my purchase! As Advertised I love the color of this fanny bag, however, it is not made for athletic/toned waists! The strap won't adjust to a smaller waist so it kind of sags a bit. I love that it's organic! This was exactly what I was after for a fanny pack to use as sling bag. Big enough to hold a small wallet, phone, earbuds, sunglasses, and other little essentials, but small enough that even when full it sits pretty flush with your body whether on front or back and doesn't look weird or obstruct your arm movement. (Probably not as flat as a bag that is meant only for sling use, but I like that I have the fanny pack option so that's a tradeoff I chose.)  Love the metal hooks and durable, natural material in some great color options! I would love a darker eggplant purple shade if that's ever added.
