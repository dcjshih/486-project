An automated order confirmation e-mail will also be sent to the address indicated by the user with acknowledgement of receipt, with a description of the order and the personal details provided. If you do not receive this e-mail, this could be due to a temporary communications problem in the network or an error in the e-mail address entered. In both cases, Mango advises the user to contact Customer Services. Similarly, an e-mail will be sent to the user confirming that the product has been dispatched. All orders are subject to the products being available.

If this is not possible, the user will be notified immediately. In addition, the amount charged for the unsent item will be refunded to the customer, using the same payment method used to purchase the item. Mango may cancel or refuse to accept any confirmed order on the following grounds: Mango will fully reimburse any sums that have been paid. All items purchased from Mango are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items are passed to the customer upon Mango's delivery to the carrier. Customers may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied after a shipment reaches their country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the customer; Mango has no control over these charges and cannot predict what they might be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; Mango recommend its customers to contact their local customs office for further information. Additionally, when ordering from Mango, customers are considered the importer of record, and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which they are receiving the goods. Generally, customs forms for international packages will list the value of their order's contents by product type. Customers' privacy is important to Mango. Therefore, Mango wants its international customers and customers who ship products internationally to be aware that cross-border shipments are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities. Also, Mango may provide certain order, shipment, and product information, such as titles, to its international carriers, and such information may be communicated by the carriers to customs authorities in order to facilitate customs clearance and comply with local laws. The prices on this Webpage are quoted in USD (taxes not included). Mango allows users the option to select the destination country before placing their order, so that they can see the prices with the corresponding taxes included. If the customer subsequently modifies the delivery address and the destination country, the prices displayed in the final summary of the order may vary. Sales tax is charged (if applicable) according to the shipping address of your order or asprovidedin applicable lawandregulations. The taxes for an order depends on the shipment address as required by applicable law.Where required, tax is also applied to the shipping and handling charges.

In order to offer maximum security in the payment system, Mango uses the secure payment systems of the leading financial entities in e-commerce.

For payment by Visa, MasterCard and American Express, Mango only accepts SET transactions (Secure Electronic Transactions) using the 3D Secure international protocol, which can be identified by the Verified by Visa, MasterCard SecureCode and American Express Safekey logos. The basic aim of the Secure Electronic Transactions initiative is to guarantee the security of Internet transactions. When you make payment through the secure payment gateway, the system will automatically check whether the credit card has been activated for Secure Electronic Transactions. Next, it will connect with the issuing bank of the card, which will request authorisation for the operation via a personal authentication code. The operation will only proceed if the issuing bank of the card confirms the authentication code. In all other cases, the transaction will be rejected. We also have the GeoTrust SSL safety certificate for online transactions. As a complementary measure to the \u2018Secure payment\u2019 system, and in order to collaborate in the prevention of Internet fraud, Mango reserves the right to check the personal details provided by customers and to take the appropriate steps (including the cancellation of the order) in order to ensure that goods are dispatched in accordance with the data that is stated on the order. Mango does not permit the purchase of Mango products for subsequent resale. Consequently, it is not possible to make purchases for an amount that exceeds $ 4,000, or for more than 40 items. Customers who wish to make purchases in excess of said amount or quantity for purposes other than resale should contact Customer Services, where they will be informed of the various options for making the desired purchase.

Please note that all orders are subject to verification. Orders can be tracked via the Mango.com Webpage, indicating the location of the goods at each moment until final reception.The delivery cost is calculated according to the delivery method chosen and the items purchased.

If the products in their confirmed order are delivered separately, on different dates, the dispatch date of the last product shall apply for the purposes of the return. Mango cannot accept exchanges or returns of used or damaged items (except in the case of flaws).

It is not possible to change one model for another: it is only possible to exchange it for a different size.

In the case of refunds, customers will be given a till receipt as proof of the return and a refund will be requested.

Items in the CAPSULE collection can be exchanged or returned within 14 days of the delivery date. These items cannot be exchanged or returned if they do not have the original labels on. Exchanging a garment for another size or returning a garment is also possible by mail, at the following address: MANGO RETURNS - C/O Carbel Easton One1520 Van Buren RdEaston, PA 18045 In such cases, Mango recommends customers to track and insure your package, at your expense, as Mango is not responsible for any items that fail to reach its warehouses. The postage expenses of items being exchanged or returned shall be borne by the customer and under no circumstances will Mango accept returns sent carriage due. These conditions apply to returns of orders placed via the iPad at physical stores of Mango. In this case, exchanges will not be accepted. Once the items are received, Mango will ensure they are in good condition and will dispatch the requested size in the case of an exchange or refund the purchase amount via the same payment method used in the purchase in the case of refunds. The refund will be carried within 3-12 business days from reception of the return at the Mango warehouses. Once the condition of the returned items has been inspected, the customer will be notified by e-mail. The returned items will always be refunded via the same payment method used to purchase them. In cases where Mango has erroneously sent an item different to the one ordered or the quality of the item sent is not acceptable, Mango, once it has checked the error or defect, will refund the price of the returned item and the proportional part of the original postage expenses. Whenever an erroneous or defective item is returned by ordinary post, Mango will refund the corresponding postage expenses provided the customer encloses a receipt of the return expenses in the parcel. Please note that the postage expenses will be reimbursed after the items are reimbursed. In these cases, returns or exchanges must be returned via Standard, Ground or Regular shipping method. Please remember to include the receipt for the delivery costs of the refund. Mango shall not owe any liability to the customer when the product contained in the parcel returned by the customer is incorrect. Notwithstanding the above, in cases where the customer erroneously sends a product different to the one stated in the order and it is possible to process the collection of the item, the customer must organise its return and cover the corresponding costs of said collection. Note that Mango will not reimburse the proportional part of the delivery costs incurred when returning the merchandise via Express, Overnight or 2 Day Shipping. To customers who make purchases as consumers, Mango offers warranties on the products marketed through the Website/Application for any non-conformities regarding the same that become apparent within a period of three (3) years from delivery of the product. In the absence of proof to the contrary, it shall be presumed that any non-conformities that become apparent within two (2) years of delivery of the product already existed when the product was delivered. Consequently, if any of the products do not conform to the contract, the customer should notify Mango by any of the communication methods set out below. Customers can only purchase gift cards via the Website/Application and may only use them to purchase items that are for sale on the aforementioned Website/Application. When purchasing a gift card, the customer may not add any other items to the order and may only purchase one gift card per order. In order to process the purchase of the gift card, the following data will be requested regarding the person who is to receive it: name, surname and e-mail address. This data will only be used for the correct management of the gift card. Only one gift card may be used per order as a form of payment and cannot be combined with other promotional discounts. If the amount of the order is less than the value of the gift card, the remaining balance will be available to the customer for use on future orders. In the event that the total amount of the order is greater than the amount of the gift card used, the remaining balance must be paid by the customer using the payment methods accepted on the Website/Application. The exchange and/or return policy for orders paid with a gift card will be the same as for other orders placed on the Website/Application. The amount to be refunded will be charged to the gift card balance. Recharging the gift card balance will take approximately fourteen (14) calendar days from the date on which the refund is made. At the time the recharge is made, the customer will be informed via e-mail of the new available balance. If part of the order has been paid with a payment card, the refund amount will be paid first from the payment card used and the rest of the amount to be refunded from the gift card balance.

The Gift Card exclusively grants its holder the possibility of acquiring, depending on the balance existing on it, one or more items of clothing and/or accessories that are on sale at that time in the MANGO line stores, including MANGO Outlet, located in the country of purchase of said card. Therefore, the Gift Card may not, under any circumstances, be exchanged for money or exchanged for gift cards or similar instruments (see gift vouchers, vouchers, promotional codes, among others) from other commercial establishments. In addition, the Gift Card will not be valid in Mango stores located in department stores or airports, or in the online stores Mango.com   and Mangooutlet.com. The Gift Card may only be used in the country in which the Gift Card was purchased. Under no circumstances may it be used in a country other than the one in which it was purchased. The value of the Gift Card is that at the time of its activation. The Gift Card may be used to make any purchases the holder wishes until the balance of the card is exhausted. The balance of the Gift Card will decrease as it is used to purchase clothing and/or accessories in the Mango   stores mentioned above. In any case, the balance on the Gift Card will appear on the purchase receipt and can be consulted in any of the stores mentioned above. The validity and expiration of the Gift Card will be detailed on the card itself. After this period, the Gift Card will have no value and therefore cannot be used in any Mango store. Likewise, after this period, the balance on the Gift Card will not be refundable by any means and cannot be claimed by the holder of the Card under any circumstances. The Gift Card is not reloadable. Under no circumstances will the balance on the Card be returned to the holder of the Card, whether in cash or by any other means of payment. Once the balance has been exhausted, the Gift Card must be returned to the Mango store. Items purchased using a gift card can only be exchanged for other items. The resolution of any conflict, dispute or divergence that may arise in relation to the Gift Card will be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the law.   These purchase conditions are subject to New Jersey laws. Sales will be deemed to be performed at the address of Mango. In case of dispute between the parties of this contract, the competent jurisdiction will be the corresponding jurisdiction in every case. MANGO LIKES YOU LOYALTY PROGRAMME 1.

Verification may take place: 8. HOW TO EARN \u201cLIKES\u201d 8.1. Earn Likes through Eligible Purchases Once Participants have identified themselves, they may accumulate Likes by purchasing Eligible Products (defined below) in participating Stores or purchasing online on at a Site. Each award of Likes has an expiration period of one (1) year from the day of the award. If the one-year period elapses without the Participant having exchanged the Likes as explained in Section 9, they will be automatically deactivated. \u201cEligible Products\u201d refers to garments and accessories that are branded to business lines operated by MANGO. For each Eligible Product purchase made by a verified Participant, the Participant will earn Likes in accordance with the following formula: $1.00 (One Dollar) spent of the \u201cRRP\u201d = 4 Likes = 0.02 Dollar discount \u201cRRP\u201d means the recommended retail price (excluding taxes). If the Eligible Product is on sale (subject to a discount) at the time of purchase, the RRP means the discounted sale price. (excluding taxes) 8.2.

The award of Likes for this action is only valid with the first installation or update and login to the MANGO App. 9. EXCHANGE OF LIKES Participants may exchange (also referred to as redeeming) the Likes they earned for discounts on future purchases of Eligible Products or services offered by MANGO as described below: 9.1. Exchange of Likes for discounts on future purchases The Participant must have at least 1,000 accumulated Likes to be able to redeem LIKES for discounts on purchases of MANGO clothing and other Eligible Products. Likes are not redeemable for discounts on products from other brands. The discount may be used in conjunction with other promotions or sales offered by MANGO, subject to a maximum upper limit equivalent to fifty percent (50%) of the initial recommended retail price (RRP) of the Eligible Product (excluding taxes). Discounts will be applied to the RRP of the Eligible Products (excluding taxes). Under no circumstances may Likes be exchanged for money or for their value in kind. 9.2. Exchange of Likes for services offered by MANGO The Participant may exchange Likes for services offered by MANGO and its partners when these are sufficient as described in the \"Benefits\" Section of the Sites. 10. GENERAL RULES OF OPERATION The operating rules regarding the earning and exchange of Likes are summarized below: 11. MANGO reserves the right to initiate whatever action it deems appropriate in the event of detecting fraudulent or suspicious behavior by Participants who are not making proper use of the benefits offered by the Program. 12. HOW DO LIKES WORK WITH GIFT CARDS? Likes cannot be earned when you purchase a gift card; nor can you exchange Likes to purchase a Gift Card. If a Participant receives a Gift Card, that Participant may pay for an Eligible Purchase using the Gift Card or a combination of the Gift Card and their accumulated Likes. 13. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIKES AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS Likes are only earned when you purchase an Eligible Product (i.e., Mango-branded product) and can only be redeemed to purchase Eligible Products. Likes are not earned and cannot be redeemed to purchase products from other brands. If you purchase both Eligible Products and non-eligible products at the same time, you may redeem Likes only toward the purchase price of the Eligible Products or earn new Likes based only on the purchase price of the Eligible Products. 14. PROCEDURES FOR RETURNS AND/OR EXCHANGES OF PRODUCTS Returns and exchanges must be made in accordance with our return/exchange policies. If you make a return or exchange of an Eligible Product for which you used Likes to make the original purchase or earned Likes at the time of purchase, MANGO will adjust the Likes in your account as follows:  15. PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM OUTSIDE THE US US Participants will earn Likes on purchases they make in countries other than the USA if the other countries are within the Program Territory. They may also redeem Likes when making purchases in other countries if the other countries are within the Program Territory. In countries other than USA, the Participant may earn Likes in accordance with the rules applicable to that country. For information about how the Program operates for Eligible Products purchased outside the USA, please ask in-Store staff, or check the website available for such country. 16. EFFECTIVE DATE, PROGRAM CHANGES, AND DURATION OF THE PROGRAM The Program will become effective on 4<sup>th</sup> April 2024 and will have an indefinite duration.  MANGO reserves the right to cancel the Program or modify the Program Terms at any time as explained in Section 3. MANGO will notify Participants by posting on the Sites, by notice to Participants\u2019 accounts, or by e-mail to their e-mail address registered with MANGO. If a modification will significantly impact Participants\u2019 rights in a negative way, appropriate advance notice will be provided. The modification or cancellation of the Program will not impact redemptions prior to the effective date specified in the notice. The modification or cancellation of the Program will not entitle the Participant to any compensation. 17. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM MANGO LIKES YOU is intended to be a program primarily for customers who maintain an online MANGO account. Consequently, Participants who withdraw from participation in the Program will also have their online account automatically cancelled. If your account is cancelled, you will only be able to shop online as a guest. A participant who withdraws from the Program will lose all Likes remaining in their account without any possibility of recovering them later. A Participant may cancel their participation in the Program, and consequently process their cancellation as a participant, via the following channels: If the Participant exercises their right to request deletion of their e-mail address or mobile telephone number, their participation in MANGO LIKES YOU will automatically be cancelled and, consequently, they will lose accumulated Likes, in addition to any other prior benefits they may have obtained with the accumulation of Likes. This is because MANGO relies on this information to verify a Participant\u2019s identity before awarding Likes or processing the redemption of Likes for Eligible Purchases. Similarly, if the Participant informs MANGO that their place of residence is located outside the Program Territory, their subscription to MANGO LIKES YOU will automatically be cancelled and, consequently, they will lose accumulated Likes, in addition to any other prior benefits they may have obtained with the accumulation of Likes. 18. PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA For more information regarding how MANGO collects and processes personal data, please see our Privacy Policy-USA. 19. GOVERNING LAW These Program Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to choice of law principles. 20.

This applies even if foreseeable or even if Mango has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Without limiting the foregoing, Mango is not responsible for (i) any loss or misdirection of, or delay in grants or redemptions of Likes or other Program benefits; (ii) theft or unauthorized redemption of Likes; or (ii) any errors made or published in relation to the Program, including, without limitation, any pricing or typographical errors, errors of description, and errors in the adding, subtracting, crediting, and/or debiting of Likes to/from Participant accounts.

YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS BROUGHT IN COURT AND TO ARBITRATE OR PARTICIPATE IN ARBITRATION ON A CLASS BASIS. YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, AND NOT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. YOU AND MANGO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. Any disputes regarding this arbitration provision, including applicability, enforcement, validity, or interpretation, shall be resolved by the arbitrator. In the event that any issues not addressed by this arbitration provision will be entertained by a court, the court must be a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware. The allocation of costs between the parties shall be allocated in accordance with the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards (the \u201cStandards\u201d). Unless prohibited by the Standards or JAMS Rules, each party will bear their own costs in connection with the arbitration. Arbitration Rules and Governing Law: This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS in accordance with the Standards and other applicable JAMS Rules then in effect, except as modified here. The JAMS Rules are available at www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/. The Standards are available here https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/. In order to initiate arbitration, a completed written demand (available at www.jamsadr.com/submit/) must be filed with the JAMS and provided to the other party, as specified in the JAMS rules. Pursuant to the Standards, the parties may exchange non-privileged information relevant to the dispute as part of the arbitration. Fees and Costs of Arbitration: Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the Standards. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, the arbitrator may determine an appropriate allocation of fees between the parties.

Exceptions to the Arbitration Provision: You and Mango each agree that the following causes of action and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction (i) any claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack); or (iii) any claim for the remedy of public injunctive relief. You and Mango agree that, if applicable, the remedy of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act. Notwithstanding the provisions above, no party shall be precluded from seeking remedies in small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of its jurisdiction. Selection of Arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) business days of the date of the written request for arbitration, the arbitration will proceed before an arbitrator selected by JAMS. To initiate arbitrations on proceedings in circumstances where the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, the party initiating the arbitration request shall first notify the other party in writing that no agreement can be reached on the selection, and then that party shall submit a request to JAMS requesting the appointment of an arbitrator. The designated arbitrator shall have experience and expertise in the subject matter of the dispute.

        "From the moment it's conceived to the moment it's worn. Each and every one of our garments follows this path. This could be done at a fast pace. At Mango, however, we choose to take care of all those who walk this path with us. Taking the time, attending to every step, every stitch, every fold, every finish\u2026 Exploring the landscape and gathering more and more fibers with a lower environmental impact. Breathing in the unmistakable, perfect and timeless style with which nature designs every detail, while reducing the footprint our journey may have on the planet. This is our path, which is taking shape as we walk it. And we believe in it. 72% of our fibers now come from preferred sources. 94% of our cotton now comes from preferred sources. 25% of our fibers are now recycled. 67% of all the energy we consume is now renewable. Since 2019, we have reduced the quantity of water used to extract materials by 47%. We are pioneers in the use of paper bags for factory packaging instead of single-use plastic bags: we have prevented the use of 885 tonnes of plastic since the start of the project. We now have Recycling Box containers in our stores in 19 countries and collect around 163 tonnes of textile waste from our customers every year. We are the first major fashion brand in Spain to make public its list of traced factories. 100% of our fibers will come from preferred sources. Our circular economy ambition will extend to the majority of our collection. We will have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 80% and our Scope 3 emissions by 35%. We design all our garments in our atelier in Barcelona. We have a full-time professional team of more than 60 people who guarantee the quality of our products. We carry out almost 20,000 inspections annually at our suppliers' factories to guarantee the quality of our garments. All our products are thoroughly tested to certify that they are safe for use by our customers, complying with the relevant legislation on harmful chemicals. Get to know our preferred-source materials The circular economy offers an alternative to the traditional \"throwaway\" model of production and consumption, so that materials in use can be reused or recycled, rather than becoming waste. We believe that collaboration is key to achieving this goal. For this reason, we work to identify and support suppliers with established recycling structures and circuits, which allow us to increase the company's percentage of recycled fibers. We design our products with their end-of-life in mind, whether this means ensuring they are recyclable through their composition and construction, promoting durability or using patterns that minimize textile waste. We collaborate with independent laboratories and align ourselves with recognized international standards to offer products with greater durability, in order to strengthen our commitment to circularity. In line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, at Mango we offer our customers the chance to give their used clothes and shoes a second chance through our Recycling Boxes. Everything deposited in these containers will be given a new life following the waste management hierarchy: Garments that can be used are distributed in the second-hand channel. The most deteriorated garments are transformed into textile fibers or raw materials for new uses, such as thermal insulation, among others. The product that can no longer be recycled is converted into energy in the form of electricity or steam by controlled combustion. Currently, 100% of our company stores in 19 countries offer this service. In 2019, this project joined our Mango likes you club. Therefore, when customers deposit their used garments in the Recycling Boxes, they will receive 200 Likes* in their account to access exclusive benefits and experiences. *Limited to one recycling every 30 days. Not available in Outlet stores or stores located in airports or corners in department store. At Mango we are committed to respecting and promoting the human rights of all the people we interact with: our teams, customers, workers in the value chain and communities. We have a Human Rights Policy that sets out our highest-level commitment to human rights and is aligned with leading international standards. 100% of our manufacturing plants have a social audit. True to our commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion, we strive to ensure a respectful and inclusive work environment, free of all forms of discrimination.

If we determine that your Consumer Request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.\r\n               As described above, our use of cookies is considered a \u201csale\u201d under the CPRA.

        "Specifically chosen for the dapper and emboldened, men\u2019s new arrivals at Banana Republic use an array of fabrics, prints, and silhouettes to take you through the seasons with ease, especially when it comes to linen. A LAND OF LINEN There\u2019s a reason world travelers always circle back to this incredible fabric. Linen is a beloved luxury item from season to season, primarily for its breathability. Whether worn under a blazer or solo, men\u2019s linen shirts and linen pants have the magical ability to stay cool and comfortable, even when temperatures rise. Many say it\u2019s the perfect garment for adventure as it dries faster than other fabrics and retains its durability \u2014 an easy-care option for adventures that require sink washing. Our designers are especially proud of our men\u2019s sweaters with beautiful craftsmanship and color depth to take with you on every journey in need of rugged wardrobe options. Let us explore layering as a way to open up multiple ways of wear, like men\u2019s shorts paired with men\u2019s cotton sweaters. THE ART OF LAYERING Men\u2019s dress shirts are a foundational piece in any wardrobe. But when away on business or pleasure, styling options may tend to run low. That\u2019s where BR comes to the rescue with layerable pieces to draw out your closet with ease. Take our men\u2019s dress shirts and style them three ways. Sure, this classic style looks incredible alone, but have you considered wearing it under our men\u2019s sweaters? Or perhaps unbuttoned and layered over a casual t-shirt men's casual pants. Are cooler temperatures of concern? Reach for one of our most luxurious fabrications: warm Merino wool blended with plush cashmere. The options are endless when it comes to dressing for your journey, and not every adventure requires a suit (thought our men\u2019s suits are considerably dapper). PANTS THAT TRAVEL We\u2019d be doing you a disservice if we didn\u2019t mention our cargo pants. Made to journey with you for seasons to come, our men\u2019s cargo pants are perfectly tapered with plenty of pocket space to store everything you need while keeping your hands free.",

Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting our Sites or Stores or communicating with us in other ways, you are agreeing to the collection, use and processing of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access our Sites, or provide your personal data. Based in Barcelona, Spain, MANGO has focused on creativity and dynamic design in the fashion and lifestyle industry for the past four decades. You can contact our corporate headquarters at: Postal address: Atenci\u00f3n al Cliente, carrer dels Mercaders 9-11 (Pol\u00edgono Industrial Riera Caldes), 08184 Palau-solit\u00e0 i Plegamans (Barcelona), Spain Telephone number: 1.866.6MNGMNG (1.866.666.4664) Email address: personaldata@mango.com Registered at the Mercantile Register of Barcelona under Volume 11195, Folio 156, Sheet 167948 and with Corporate Tax ID no. ES-B59088948. We use the term \u201cpersonal data\u201d in this Privacy Policy to refer to information in any form that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer. MANGO collects personal data that you submit to us, is collected online using cookies and similar internet technologies, when you visit our Sites, and when you communicate with us in other ways. We also may receive personal data from social media, marketing resources, and other third parties. We collect personal data, for example, when you: This Privacy Policy does not apply to: Collection by third party websites. Our Sites may contain links to social media and third-party websites that we do not operate or control. These may include, for example, credit/debit processors and installment sales providers. The information practices and the content of these third-party sites are governed by their own privacy practices. We encourage you to review the privacy statements posted by third-party websites to understand how they will manage your information. Anonymized or aggregated information. Information that has been modified in a substantial way so that it no longer can reasonably identify or be linked to an individual. Employment and business communications. Information we obtain about our employees, job applicants, and other personnel and the employees and representatives of business customers, service providers, suppliers, and business partners (except as explained in the section titled Notice for California Residents: your California Privacy Rights). Below are the categories of personal data collected by or on behalf of MANGO in the preceding twelve months and examples of the types of data, including personal data, within each category.

When you place an order online, we will ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, payment card number and other details, contact preferences, and shipping information. Your payment will be processed using a system certified under the Payment Card Industry-Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), which may be operated either by MANGO or by a third-party payment processor. If a third-party processor is used, you will be transferred to the processor\u2019s website to provide your card information. MANGO stores the expiration date and postal code associated with your payment card but does not store your full payment card number or the CVV number. Instead, we use a service provider to create a token we can store that represents your card\u2019s primary account number. If you choose to pay using a payment service such as PayPal or an installment service such as Klarna or Afterpay, the third-party service may require your name, email address, payment card, and other information. The service partner may provide some non-financial information to us. In-store purchases using a credit or debit card are processed by third-party payment processing service and MANGO does not collect token or other information. Transaction history.

We do not permit our third-party service providers to use the personal data that we make available to them for their own commercial purposes. Online Technical and Analytics Services:  We use Google Analytics and other authorized third-party services to measure and evaluate access to and traffic on our Sites, identify a user\u2019s language and other preferences, authenticate a user when logging in to the user\u2019s account, and identify ways to improve our Sites\u2019 performance and functionality.

These services operate as independent data controllers with respect to the collection and use of your personal data and have their own privacy policies and practices for the collection and use of personal data. We also may share your e-mail address or device ID on a secure basis with the advertising services, which they use to display MANGO banners and ads to you when you visit third-party sites and measure how many people click on our ads. See our Cookie Policy for more information about cookies and how you can restrict the types of personalized advertising that involve tracking your internet activity in a way that identifies you. Affiliates. We may share information, including personal data, with companies that share common corporate ownership with MANGO, and they may use that information for purposes that are consistent with those described in this Privacy Policy. With Your Consent. We may share personal data with third parties when we have your consent to do so. Security and Protection.

Business Transaction Parties. We reserve the right to disclose or transfer your personal data, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards, in connection with a business transaction such as a financing, reorganization, merger, or sale of a business. We maintain commercially reasonable security measures appropriate to the nature of the personal data we collect. However, neither people nor systems can operate in a fully secure manner and no method of transmission over the internet or storage of electronic data is fully secure. While we use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of the personal data you provide to us. Our Sites permit you to create an account protected by a password you create. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else who has obtained your password from you, even if that person was not authorized by you. You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account, and, if any unauthorized use is suspected, you should immediately reset your password. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the problem. All purchase transactions made on our Sites are processed using secure payment systems operated either by MANGO or third-party payment processors. Confidential payment details are transmitted directly in encrypted format (SSL). We and our payment processors manage your credit card information in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. Important reminder: You should never provide your credit or payment card details in an e-mail or on social media. We will retain your personal data for as long as we are continuing to communicate or provide services to you and as reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, comply with our legal obligations, enforce agreements, and resolve any disputes. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements.  In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. The MANGO Sites are directed to users who are of legal age in the state in which they live (often, but not always, age 18). In addition, MANGO does not knowingly collect personal data about children under the age of sixteen (16) years without consent from a parent or legal guardian. If you have reason to believe that we have obtained personal data about a child under age 16 without the appropriate consent, please contact us as explained in \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d and we will investigate and delete the information. E-mail marketing. You can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d instructions included in each of our e-mail marketing communications, and we will process your request to unsubscribe within ten business days after receiving it. You can also opt-out by emailing us at personaldata@mango.com and providing the names/email address that you want us to remove you from our marketing database and add you to our \u2018Do Not Contact\u2019 list. If you opt-out of marketing messages, we may still send e-mails to you that involve your orders or responses to your questions. Text messages. If you previously gave us permission to send recurring automated promotional and personalized marketing communications to you by text message, you can withdraw that consent at any time by replying following the directions provided in the text message you received. It may take up to seven days to process your request to STOP text marketing messages. If you have a MANGO online account, you can update, correct, delete, or change your account information, preferences and subscriptions and consents to receive newsletters, emails, and other marketing communications, and by logging into your account from any of our Sites. If you do not have a MANGO account, please contact us as explained in \u201cHow to Contact Us.\u201d MANGO offers loyalty programs, benefits, and account sign-up discounts for our customers in various locations. Examples of the programs we offer include the following. The MANGO Likes You. In jurisdictions where available, MANGO Likes You is a loyalty reward program for all customers when they register an online MANGO account, by providing their name, e-mail address, mobile phone number, and a password. It is also available to customers who sign up for the program in-Store by providing their name, e-mail address, and mobile phone number. Participants accumulate points, called \u201cLikes,\u201d when they purchase MANGO products or take actions such as recycling MANGO products or picking up online purchases in-Store. Members also may receive information about new products, sales, and promotions. If you choose to submit your date of birth, you will receive extra Likes as our birthday gift to you. No purchase is required to participate. You can read the detailed terms of the MANGO Likes You program on our Sites to find out how to earn Likes, use your Likes to make purchases, when they expire, and other information about the program. Newsletter Subscription. We may also offer a discount off the next purchase to customers who subscribe to our e-mail newsletter by providing their e-mail address. We use your e-mail address to send newsletters, special offers and other promotional messages. Your information may be shared with our email and advertising providers. You may unsubscribe from our newsletters and other marketing emails using the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link in each e-mail or contact us. The purpose for offering loyalty program benefits to our customers includes expanding our direct marketing outreach, enhancing our customers\u2019 shopping experience, and encouraging repeat business. Because these benefits involve some of personal data, they may be considered to offer a financial incentive or price or service difference under California and other states\u2019 privacy laws. For our MANGO online account holders, we do not request any additional personal data to be enrolled in MANGO Likes You. In situations where additional personal data is requested (such mobile phone number for in-Store enrollment) or birth date to receive an incentive reward, we believe the program benefits are reasonably related to the value to us of the personal data requested and the costs we incur in providing the program.

If your request is verified, we will delete or fully de-identify (and direct our service providers and contractors to delete or de-identify) all or part of the requested personal data from our (and their) records, unless an exclusion applies. If we are unable to fulfill all or part of your request, we will let you know why (for example, if we have a permitted reason to retain certain information or if the identity of the requesting person cannot be verified). For technical reasons and to maintain anonymous business statistics, we may anonymize or aggregate personal data rather than erase it completely from our systems. Right of non-discrimination for the exercise of your privacy rights.

MANGO respects your privacy rights and will not discriminate against you if you exercise any of your rights. Right to opt-out of sharing personal data for targeted advertising.

We are required to verify the identity any person submitting a request to know, correct, or delete personal data. If you make a request on behalf of someone else, we will need to verify your authority to make that request and may require confirmation signed by the consumer. We use methods of verification specified in the CCPA regulations such as matching information we have on file for you, such as your full name, email and postal address, phone number, and transaction history. We reserve the right to deny a consumer request if the identity or authority of the requesting party cannot be confirmed. How we respond to consumer requests. We will confirm receipt of your consumer request within ten (10) business days and may request additional information necessary to verify that you are authorized to make the request. We will respond to any verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) calendar days of receiving it, subject to delays and exceptions permitted by law. If we require more time to respond, we will let you know the reason and the extension period in writing. We will respond to your request by using the email address or U.S. Postal address you provided to us when making the request. If your request relates to personal data we have collected about you, we will provide information collected or Stored during the 12-month period before receiving your verifiable request. We do not accept or respond to requests to exercise rights sent by postal mail. If we cannot comply with all or part of your request, we will explain the reasons why. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal data that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information readily from one entity to another entity. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. We will not discriminate against you if you make a request about your personal data. Loyalty and Financial incentive programs. As explained in the section of our Privacy Policy titled \u201cLoyalty programs,\u201d customers who open an online account with MANGO are automatically enrolled in our MANGO Likes You loyalty program where available and no additional personal information is required. Customers may enroll in the program in-Store where available by providing their name, e-mail address, and mobile phone number. Additional incentives may be offered to customers who submit other personal data such as their birth date.  By opening a MANGO online account or enrolling in-Store in the MANGO Likes You program, customers may receive a more favorable price or rate for products and services than is available to customers who do not participate in the programs. Please see the Terms and Conditions on our Sites for details about the current loyalty programs available where you reside. Under the CCPA, differences in price or rate for loyalty program participants are not discriminatory and permitted if they are reasonably related to the value of the personal data collected by choosing to participate the loyalty program. We estimate that value or personal data collected via a loyalty program by taking into account the anticipated revenues from enhanced sales of products incentivized by the program and the expenses we incur in providing the program. Those expenses may include, for example, the cost of discounting purchases made by program participants, managing, and operating the program, and offering free shipping on some purchases. Based on that estimate, we believe in good faith that the price or rate differences offered through our programs are reasonably related to the value of the participants\u2019 data. California rights under \u201cshine the light\u201d law. California residents may request a list of the types of customer information we provided to third parties for their direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we have shared such information during the past calendar year. We will provide the information to you free of charge within 30 days of your request. You can request this information by emailing personaldata@mango.com. Within thirty (30) days of receiving your request, we will provide you with the information at the address you designate in your request, which may be an email address or postal address.

If we wish to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. We may process personal data without your consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. If you have any questions about how PLT use any of your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at DPO@prettylittlething.com. You have several rights under the data privacy legislation. This includes, under certain circumstances, the right to: \u00a0 Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please email us at DPO@prettylittlething.com.. Request access to your personal data You have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data we hold about you and certain information relating to our processing of your personal data. Request correction of your personal data You are entitled to have your personal data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete. You can update your personal data at any time by logging into your account and updating your details directly, or by emailing us at DPO@prettylittlething.com. Request erasure of your personal data  This enables you to request that PLT delete your personal data, where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. Request restriction of processing of your personal data You have a right to ask PLT to suspend the processing of your personal data in certain scenarios, for example if you want us to establish the accuracy of the data, or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. Where processing is restricted, we are allowed to retain sufficient information about you to ensure that the restriction is respected in future. Request the transfer of your personal data You have the right to obtain a digital copy of your personal data or request the transfer of your personal data to another company. Please note though that this right only applies to automated data which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the data to perform a contract with you. Object to processing of your personal data You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we believe we have a legitimate interest in processing it (as explained above). You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your data which override your rights and freedoms. Request human intervention for automated decision making and profiling You have the right to request human intervention where we are carrying out automated decision making when processing your personal data. This form of processing is permitted where it is necessary as part of our contract with you, providing that appropriate safeguards are in place or your explicit consent has been obtained. We will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to exercise any of the above rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. Right to lodge a complaint If you have any concerns or complaints regarding the way in which we process your data, please email us directly at DPO@prettylittlething.com. You also have the right to make a complaint to the ICO (the data protection regulator in the UK) or (if you are located in the European Union) any other competent supervisory authority in your country of residence (a list of supervisory authorities can be found here: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO or any other supervisory authority, so please do contact us in the first instance. Your data and countries outside of Europe The personal data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, destinations outside the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") using legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice.\r\n              Whenever we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring appropriate safeguards, as required by law, are in place. This may include using specific contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection as it has in Europe. More information about these is available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087\r\n              Please contact us if you want further information on the countries to which we may transfer personal data and the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data outside the EEA.  We will keep your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) it was provided for and to meet our legal obligations. Further details of the periods for which we retain data are available on request. From time to time we may change this GDPR Addendum. If there are any significant changes we will post updates on our website, applications or let you know by email.

This California Privacy Addendum applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (\u201cConsumers\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d). We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (collectively, the \u201cCPRA\u201d) and any terms defined in the CPRA have the same meaning when used in this notice. This California Privacy Addendum applies to information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you or your device (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d) that we collect when you use our websites, iOS and android applications, when you interact with us through social media, email, or phone, or when you participate in our competitions or events. It also applies to your Personal Information to the extent that someone has nominated you through our \"refer a friend\" function or purchased an e-gift card on your behalf. However, publicly available information that we collect from government records and deidentified or aggregated information (when deidentified or aggregated as described in the CPRA) are not considered Personal Information and this California Privacy Addendum does not apply.  This California Privacy Addendum does not apply to employment-related Personal Information collected from our California-based employees, job applicants, contractors, or similar individuals (\u201cPersonnel\u201d). Please contact your local human resources department if you are part of our California Personnel and would like additional information about how we process your Personal Information.  PLT collects, and over the prior twelve (12) months have collected, the following categories of Personal Information about Consumers: PLT will not collect additional categories of Personal Information without providing you notice. We collect Personal Information about you from the sources described in our privacy notice.  Through the use of cookies on our websites and applications, we may use, \u201csell\u201d for monetary or other valuable consideration, \u201cshare\u201d for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, or disclose the Personal Information we collect and, over the prior twelve (12) months, have used, \u201csold\u201d for monetary or other valuable consideration, \u201cshared\u201d for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, or disclosed the Personal Information we have collected, for the purposes described in our privacy notice. PLT will not use the Personal Information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.  When we disclose Personal Information to non-affiliated third-parties for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose, requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not use it for any purpose except for the purposes for which the Personal Information was disclosed and requires the recipient to otherwise comply with the requirements of the CPRA. In the preceding twelve (12) months, PLT has disclosed the following categories of Personal Information for one or more of the business purposes described below to the following categories of third parties We disclose your Personal Information to the categories of third parties listed above for the following business purposes: In addition to the above, we may disclose any or all categories of Personal Information to any third-party (including government entities and/or law enforcement entities) as necessary to: We do not sell Personal Information as the term \u201csell\u201d is commonly understood to require an exchange for money. However, the use of advertising and analytics cookies on our Website is considered a \u201csale\u201d of Personal Information as the term \u201csale\u201d is broadly defined in the CPRA to include both monetary and other valuable consideration. Our \u201csale\u201d is limited to our use of third-party advertising and analytics cookies and their use in providing behavioral advertising and their use in understanding how people use and interact with our website(s) and applications. Our \u201csales\u201d of your Personal Information in this matter is subject to your right to opt-out of those sales (see Your Choices Regarding our \u201cSale\u201d or \u201cSharing\u201d of your Personal Information).  PLT may \u201cshare\u201d your Personal Information for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, subject to your right to opt-out of that sharing (see Your Choices Regarding our \u201cSale\u201d or \u201cSharing\u201d of your Personal Information). Our \u201csharing\u201d for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising would be limited to our use of third-party advertising cookies and their use in providing you cross-context behavioral advertising (i.e., advertising on other websites or in other mediums). When the recipients of your Personal Information disclosed for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising are also permitted to use your Personal Information to provide advertising to others, we also consider this disclosure as a \u201csale\u201d for monetary or other valuable consideration under the CPRA. In the preceding twelve (12) months, PLT has \u201csold\u201d for monetary or other valuable consideration, or \u201cshared\u201d for the purpose of cross-context behavioral advertising, the following categories of Personal Information to the following categories of third parties: Your Personal Information may be \u201csold\u201d or \u201cshared\u201d as described above for the following business or commercial purposes: We do not \u201csell\u201d the Personal Information of minors under the age of 16 for monetary or other valuable consideration and we do not \u201cshare\u201d such Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising without affirmative consent as required by the CPRA. More information on how minors under the age of 16 may change their choice regarding the \u201csale\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of their Personal Information can be found in Your Choices Regarding our \u201cSale\u201d or \u201cSharing\u201d of Your Personal Information.  The CPRA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes your CPRA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. You may exercise these rights yourself or through your Authorized Agent. For more information on how you or your Authorized Agent can exercise your rights, please see Exercising Your CPRA Privacy Rights. These rights include the right to: Brief details of each of these rights are set out below. You also have the right to opt-out of our sale or sharing of your personal data, as described further below.  You have the right to request that PLT disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months (a \u201cRight to Know\u201d Consumer Request).  You also have the right to request that PLT provide you with a copy of the specific pieces of Personal Information that we have collected about you, including any Personal Information that we have created or otherwise received from a third-party about you (a \u201cData Portability\u201d Consumer Request). You have the right to request that we correct any incorrect Personal Information about you to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and as current as possible. In addition to other methods you may have to exercise this right as described below, you may review and correct some Personal Information about yourself by logging into your account page and updating your details directly.  You have the right to request that PLT delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. To exercise the rights described above, please submit a request (a \u201cConsumer Request\u201d) to us by either:  If you fail to make your Consumer Request in accordance with the ways described above, we may either treat your request as if it had been submitted with our methods described above or provide you with information on how to submit the request or remedy any deficiencies with your request. \r\n              Only you, or your Authorized Agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a Consumer Request related to your Personal Information. To designate an Authorized Agent, see Authorized Agents below. \r\n               All Consumer Requests must: We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm which Personal Information relates to you or the individual for whom you are making the request as their Authorized Agent. \r\n              Making a Consumer Request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.\r\n              We will only use Personal Information provided in a Consumer Request to verify the requestor\u2019s identity or authority to make the request. \r\n              For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see Your Choices Regarding our \u201cSale\u201d or \u201cSharing\u201d of Your Personal Information.\r\n               You may authorize your agent to exercise your rights under the CPRA on your behalf by registering your agent with the California Secretary of State or by providing them with power of attorney to exercise your rights in accordance with applicable laws (an \u201cAuthorized Agent\u201d). We may request that your Authorized Agent submit proof of identity and that they have been authorized exercise your rights on your behalf. We may deny a request from your Authorized Agent to exercise your rights on your behalf if they fail to submit adequate proof of identity or adequate proof that they have the authority to exercise your rights. \r\n              In response to a Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Request, we will provide you with all relevant information we have collected or maintained about you on or after January 1, 2022, unless an exception applies. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For Data Portability Consumer Request, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, such as CSV file(s) and/or PDF file(s).\r\n              We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your Consumer Request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. We reserve the right to consider more than two (2) total Right to Know or Data Portability Consumer Requests (or combination of the two) in a twelve (12) month period to be repetitive and/or excessive and require a fee. If we determine that your Consumer Request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.\r\n               As described above, our use of cookies is considered a \u201csale\u201d under the CPRA. We do not otherwise sell your Personal Information for monetary consideration. If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not \u201csell\u201d your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration at any time (the \u201cright to opt-out\u201d). We do not \u201csell\u201d the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the \u201cright to opt-in\u201d) from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information \u201csales\u201d may opt-out of future \u201csales\u201d at any time.  If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not share your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, which is showing advertising on other websites or other media based on your browsing history with our websites and applications (the \u201cright to opt-out\u201d). We do not share the Personal Information of Consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age for this purpose, unless we receive affirmative authorization from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to our sharing of Personal Information for these purposes may opt-out of future such sharing at any time.  To exercise the right to opt-out of the \u201csale\u201d and the \u201csharing\u201d your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising, you may do so by any of the following: clicking the link below, adjusting your cookie preferences, or by configuring your browser to send us a privacy signal as described in more detail below. You may also opt-out of such \u201csales\u201d and \u201csharing\u201d by setting your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you do not consent to our use of cookies or select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our websites or applications or other websites. You can find more information about cookies at http://www.allaboutcookies.org and http://youronlinechoices.eu.  Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize Personal Information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back into the sale of Personal Information at any time by: If you (or your Authorized Agent) submit a request to opt-in to our \u201csale\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of your Personal Information, we will use a two-step process in order to confirm that you want to opt-in for such \u201csale\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of your Personal Information. This may include confirming your choice by a popup box or other requirement to confirm your new choice.  You may also exercise your right to opt-out of the \u201csale\u201d of your Personal Information for monetary or other valuable consideration and the \u201csharing\u201d of your Personal Information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising by setting the privacy control signal on your browser, if your browser supports it. We currently recognize and support the following privacy signals sent by browsers: When we receive one of these privacy control signals, we will opt you out of any further \u201csales\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of your Personal Information when you interact with our websites or applications through that browser and on that device. We will only be able to propagate your choice to opt-out to your account if you are currently logged in when we receive the privacy control signal from your browser. When we are able to propagate your choice to your account, you will be opted out of \u201csale\u201d or \u201csharing\u201d of your Personal Information on all browsers and devices on which you are logged in, and for both online and offline \u201csales\u201d and \u201csharing.\u201d  As further described below, we do not use or disclose your Sensitive Personal Information for any purpose other than the following: We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CPRA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CPRA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information\u2019s value and contain written terms that describe the program\u2019s material aspects.

Think wrinkle-resistant tees, cute bodysuits, and trendy tank tops for women \u2013 all machine washable for easy care. FROM GOOD TO GREAT What makes a t-shirt truly great? Softness, of course, but we think it\u2019s also about how the t-shirt makes you feel every time you put it on. Think: a fit so flattering it makes you stand a little straighter, walk a little lighter and maybe even smile (even if it\u2019s only on the inside). It\u2019s why our designers work so hard to get the fit right for all our tees and leave no detail to chance. For example: a seam at the center back allow a close-to-the-body fit and a defined waist without having sides that flare out, while wrapped seams means a chafe-free feel that\u2019s soft on the inside and smooth on the outside (just like you). LINEN LOVE For centuries, this fiber has been prized for its ability to remain cool and breathable even in the hottest, most humid climates. So, when the weather heats up, reach for our women\u2019s linen t-shirt styles.

So, when the weather heats up, reach for our women\u2019s linen t-shirt styles.
